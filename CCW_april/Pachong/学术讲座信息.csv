Our main identification strategy exploits the variation in proximities between aid projects and survey locations, and the random timings of project construction relative to the survey date. Using an approach similar to difference-in-differences, we show that Chinese aid increases the probability of local employment by two percentage points within its close proximity, compared to areas near a not-yet-implemented project, relative to places that never have aid projects. Increase in employment starts immediately with project implementation and persists after project completion. The longer-term impact is driven by migration and employment of skilled labor. We also find evidence for cross-sector and spatial spillover effects. Our results persist when we use alternative datasets on employment and different empirical strategies, and when we account for the potential impact of other local development resources."

In this paper, we propose a novel method to decompose the corporate basis into three components: credit spread differential, convenience yield differential, and deviation from covered interest rate parity. With this decomposition, we document several stylized facts, and in particular, the substitution effect between safe and risky dollar assets. We provide further evidences on the substitution effect using the structural VAR analysis, which shows that a negative shock to financial intermediaries&rsquo; balance sheets causes a tightening of credit spread differential, a demand shift toward safe assets, and an appreciation of the dollar. We also find consistent holdings-level evidences using foreign investors&rsquo; aggregated holdings of safe and risky dollar assets. Lastly, we find that the substitution effect also shows great empirical plausibility for bonds denominated in the largest non-USD currencies&mdash;Euro and British Pounds&mdash;but is not highly relevant to other currencies in our sample. Our results highlight the important role of the top funding currencies, especially the U.S. dollar, in the global financial markets."

Using a bilateral monopoly framework, it interrogates the validity of the U-shaped curve (often called the &ldquo;smile curve&rdquo;) regarding the firm-level division of the gains in the global supply chains. In order to resolve the potential problems of double marginalisation and hold-up phenomenon, we use quantity fixing contracting choice as a way of vertical restraint to eliminate the incentives for vertical integration in the supply chain as well as the indeterminacy of prices stemming from the problems of bilateral monopoly. Our findings indicate that the U-shaped relationship is not universally valid. It depends on the interaction between the capability effects and cost effects of firms producing along the chain. From the consumption side, the variation of firm&rsquo;s bargaining power determines the profitability distribution along the chain, whereas labour costs and the elasticity of endogenous sunk cost with respect to the quality level of intermediate goods play a counterpart role in determining the profit sharing from the perspective of the production side. The empirical results based on the WIOD confirm our theoretical predictions."

Using the implied volatility of firm options as a market predictor of future uncertainty, we find consistent results that firms with a founder CEO are associated with a higher volatility risk premium in general. To establish causality, we use the sudden death of the CEO and the number of founders as instrumental variables and find consistent results. In contrast, when firms are in distress, founder CEOs become favorable to the firm and receive more support from banks, creditors, and employees. Overall, these results highlight a significant difference between the ex-ante risk assessment of options investors and the ex-post risk of founder CEOs."

Better credit condition has a positive impact on the labor market as firms save on financing cost, improve profitability, and create more vacancies. Inflation affects unemployment through two opposing channels. First, inflation increases the firm&rsquo;s financing cost, which discourages job creation and increases unemployment. Second, inflation lowers wages because unemployed workers carry higher real balances and suffer more from inflation compared to employed workers. This encourages job creation. The overall effect of inflation on employment can be positive or negative and depends crucially on the firm&rsquo;s credit condition. We calibrate the model to match U.S. data before the great recession. The calibrated model suggests a small welfare cost of inflation and a downward-sloping Phillips curve with a flexible wage setting. We find that the firm&rsquo;s credit condition is as important as the nominal interest rate to understand the unemployment movement./spanp class=""MsoNormal""span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;""o:p/o:p/span"

In the feasible structural form, missing links make all covariates endogenous and add a new source of correlation between the errors and endogenous peer outcomes (in addition to simultaneity), thus invalidating conventional estimators used in the literature. We resolve these issues by rescaling peer outcomes with estimates of missing rates and constructing instruments that exploit properties of the noisy network measures. We apply our method to study peer effects in household decisions to participate in a microfinance program in Indian villages. We find that ignoring missing links and applying conventional instruments would result in a sizeable upward bias in peer effect estimates."

Using a unique sample of U.S. consulting contracts and a negative shock to trust between shareholders/managers (principals) and consultants (agents) staggered across space and over time, we find that lower trust increases contract completeness. Not only contract complexity but also the verifiable states of the world covered by contracts increase after trust among parties drops. The results hold for several novel text-analysis-based measures of contract completeness and do not arise in falsification tests. At the clause level, we find that non-compete agreements, confidentiality, indemnification, and termination rules are the most likely clauses added to contracts after a negative shock to trust and these additions are not driven by changing boilerplate contract templates over time."

We measure economic narratives quantitatively from the full text content of over 880,000 Wall Street Journal articles and represent them as interpretable news topics. The results indicate that narrative-based forecasts are more accurate than the benchmarks both in-sample and out-of-sample, which perform especially well during recession periods. Narrative-based forecasts perform better in the long-run forecasting, suggesting that narratives help to capture the slowly-varying trend inflation objectives. Information about inflation expectations and prices of specific goods embedded in narratives contributes to its predictive power. Overall, we provide a novel representation of economic narratives and highlight the important role of economic narratives in inflation forecasting."

Two types of time-varying graphs are investigated: one containing directed edges of Granger causality linkages, and the other containing undirected edges of partial correlation linkages. Under the sparse structural assumption, we propose a penalised local linear method with time-varying weighted group LASSO to jointly estimate the transition matrices and identify their significant entries, and a time-varying CLIME method to estimate the precision matrices. The estimated transition and precision matrices are then used to determine the time-varying network structures. Under some mild conditions, we derive the theoretical properties of the proposed estimates including the consistency and oracle properties. In addition, the developed methodology and theory are extended to highly correlated large-scale time series, for which the sparsity assumption becomes invalid and factor-adjusted time-varying networks are estimated. Extensive simulation studies and an empirical application to a large U.S. macroeconomic dataset are provided to illustrate the finite-sample performance of the developed methods."

Building on the statistical treatment choice framework, we propose Time-series Empirical Welfare Maximization (T-EWM) methods to estimate an optimal policy rule for the current period or over multiple periods by maximizing an empirical welfare criterion constructed using nonparametric potential outcome time-series. We characterize conditions under which T-EWM consistently learns a policy choice that is optimal in terms of conditional welfare given the time-series history. We then derive a nonasymptotic upper bound for conditional welfare regret and its minimax lower bound. To illustrate the implementation and uses of T-EWM, we perform simulation studies and apply the method to estimate optimal monetary policy rules from macroeconomic time-series data."

Each unit is associated with multiple clusters. For example, a firm can belong to the high productivity group and the low output elasticity group. In contrast, the standard one-dimensional clustering approach would be based on separate groups for each productivity-elasticity pair. Our approach provides substantial gains in estimation accuracy when unobserved features have sparse interactions, e.g., there are only a few firms with high productivity and low output elasticity. We propose an estimator for the unobserved group memberships and the group-specific and common parameters in a nonlinear GMM framework and derive its large sample properties. In particular, we provide the first classification consistency result in a nonlinear GMM setup. We re-evaluate the rise of aggregate markup in De Loecker, Eeckhout, and Unger (2018) by replacing their sector-specific production functions with a cluster-based one. We find that the upward trajectory persists, but the magnitude is less pronounced after accounting for multi-dimensional heterogeneity."

A localised pre-averaging method is proposed to jointly tackle the microstructure noise and asynchronicity issues, and obtain uniformly consistent estimates for latent prices. We impose a continuous-time factor model with time-varying factor loadings on the price processes, and estimate the common factors and loadings via a local principal component analysis. Assuming a uniform sparsity condition on the idiosyncratic volatility structure, we combine the POET and kernel-smoothing techniques to estimate the spot volatility matrices for both the latent prices and idiosyncratic errors. Under some mild restrictions, the estimated spot volatility matrices are shown to be uniformly consistent with convergence rates affected by the estimation errors due to the microstructure noise, asynchronicity and latent factor structures. Numerical studies are provided to assess the performance of the developed methods."

The CDS effect is stronger for firms with larger risk-shifting agency conflict, consistent with the view that the alleviation of creditors&rsquo; risk concerns is the main mechanism driving this effect. Additionally, we document that the increase in CEO compensation vega caused by CDS trading results into more risk taking, which, however, does not lead to an improvement in firm performance and shareholder value."

In this talk, we explore how AI could help physicians in prescribing medicines for patients with multi-morbidity (i.e., co-occurrence of two or more diseases). Both Supervised Learning (SL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have been employed for this purpose, but with their own drawbacks. For instance, SL relies highly on the clinical guideline and doctors personal experience while RL may produce unacceptable medications due to lack of the supervision from doctors. In this talk, we propose a novel SAVER framework by fusing RL and SL, where RL learns the optimal policy and SL gives a regularization to avoid unacceptable risks. Our experiments show that our SAVER framework can provider more accuracy treatment recommendation than the existing methods."

Longevity shocks shift life insurers&rsquo; demand for bonds of specific maturities. When longevity increases, life insurance companies invest more in long-term bonds. Consequently, long-term bond yields decline. The corporate sector absorbs these shocks by shifting to long-term debt issuances while increasing investment in long-term assets. Our results suggest that improvements in life expectancy reduce long-term corporate financing costs and stimulate long-term corporate investment."

We construct estimators of factors for both the efficient log-prices and the microstructure noise as well as their common components, and prove the uniform consistency of these estimators when the number of assets and the sampling frequency go to infinity. In a Monte Carlo exercise, we compare our DPCA method to a PCA-VECM method.

At present, China has not implemented a national forest carbon sequestration policy; instead, China focuses on promoting forest carbon sequestration based on the existing forest policies. This study studies two key forest projects in China, namely, the banning of commercial logging of natural forests and the returning farmland to forests. Using a dynamic partial equilibrium model of the forestry sector: Global Timber Model (GTM), and incorporating the Eighth National Forest Inventory Census Data, we project the dynamic response of wood production, market price, management intensity and forest carbon sink under different policy scenarios. The results show that the logging banning could not induce additional carbon sinks in the short-term; the policy of returning farmland to forests has a strong positive effect on carbon sinks in the short and long term; Without any policy interventions, China's forest stock can still achieve an increase of 3.723 billion cubic meters between 2005 and 2030, accounting for 82.73% of the forestry target (4.5 billion cubic meters) promised by the National Independent Contribution (NDC)."

In this talk, I will present an emerging theory &ndash; functional graph theory (FunGraph) derived from the combination of evolutionary game theory, predator-prey theory and developmental modularity theory into graph theory. FunGraph can chart the mechanistic roadmap of how each element influences system dynamics directly or through a web of indirect pathways.

Moreover, borrower moral norms result in favorable lending outcomes through the channels of enhancing the creditworthiness and predictability of borrower behaviors. Ex post analysis suggests that borrowers from regions with stronger moral norms have lower loan default probabilities, and their lenders enjoy higher returns. Taken together, our findings reveal the unique role of moral norms in enhancing transaction efficiency by mitigating the adverse selection and moral hazard problems in peer-to-peer lending.&nbsp;"

Instead of using an iterative algorithm which is the standard practice for estimating CP-decompositions, we propose a new and one-pass estimation procedure based on a generalized eigenanalysis constructed from the serial dependence structure of the underlying process. A key idea of the new procedure is to project a generalized eigenequation defined in terms of rank-reduced matrices to a lower-dimensional one with full-ranked matrices, to avoid the intricacy of the former of which the number of eigenvalues can be zero, finite and infinity. The asymptotic theory has been established under a general setting without the stationarity. It shows, for example, that all the component coefficient vectors in the CP-decomposition are estimated consistently with the different error rates, depending on the relative sizes between the dimensions of time series and the sample size. The proposed model and the estimation method are further illustrated with both simulated and real data; showing effective dimension-reduction in modelling and forecasting matrix time series."

To organize the empirical analyses, we construct a theoretical model of local government spending decision-making. The model captures two types of externalities of local public education spending. One is the traditional externality due to the emigration of locally educated laborers; the other is the fiscal externality because emigrants leave their children behind to receive basic education in the hometown. The model predicts that with moderate restrictions on parameter values, per student spending on public schools in the sending regions decreases with emigration rate, and the negative relationship is stronger when more children are left behind. We test these hypotheses combining data generated from the Population Censuses and City Statistics Yearbooks. We confirm these hypotheses using both an OLS estimator and an IV estimator with a Bartik-style instrumental variable. The estimation results are robust to various measures of emigration rate and education spending and to controlling for contemporaneous policy changes.o:p/o:p/span"

This paper proposes a nonparametric TVP-VAR model using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). The novelty of this model arises from the law of motion driving the parameters being treated nonparametrically. This leads to great flexibility in the nature and extent of parameter change, both in the conditional mean and in the conditional variance. In contrast to other nonparametric and machine learning methods that are black box, inference using our model is straightforward because, in treating the parameters rather than the variables nonparametrically, the model remains conditionally linear in the mean. Parsimony is achieved through adopting nonparametric factor structures and use of shrinkage priors. In an application to US macroeconomic data, we illustrate the use of our model in tracking both the evolving nature of the Phillips curve and how the effects of business cycle shocks on inflationary measures vary nonlinearly with movements in uncertainty."

It introduces simple yet power techniques to deal with heavy tailness and dependence that stylize financial data. We showcase the applications in high frequency trading and sentiment learning from Chinese financial textual data.&nbsp;We present the predictability in ultra high-frequency finance, with focus on returns and durations. Based on 101 stocks in the S\&amp;P 100 index over 505 days, we quantified and documented the predictability and confirmed that it exists universally. We unveil important predictors and showed how the predictability depends on the market environments and stock characteristics and the timeliness of data.&nbsp;&nbsp;For Chinese text analysis, we introduce FarmPredict to let machines learn financial returns directly. Based on approximately 2 million pieces of news, we show that positive sentiments scored by our FarmPredict approach generate on average 83 bps daily excess returns, while negative news has an adverse impact of 26 bps on the days of news announcements. This asymmetric effect aligns well with the short-sale constraints in the Chinese equity market. This lends further support that our FarmPredict can learn the sentiments embedded in financial news."

This paper investigates how time cost affects the healthcare usage in both China and the US. Using the retirement age policy in both countries, we first employ a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and show that the hospitalization rate persistently increases by 20-30 percent just after retirement age. The effects are larger and more significant among the people with higher time costs prior to retirement. Then, we use the school starting date and provide further significant evidence of the impact of time cost on hospitalization among the age-eligible children. These results underline the remarkable impact of time cost on healthcare usage and provide a more comprehensive picture of moral hazard in health insurance."

We find asymmetric impacts of &ldquo;push&rdquo; and &ldquo;pull&rdquo; demographic factors in determining cross-prefecture migration. An increase in rural cohort size by 1,000 people pushes 254 migrants out of the origin prefecture, while a reduction in urban cohort size by the same amount pulls 929 migrants into the destination prefecture. The push and pull effects of cohort sizes are amplified when origin and destination prefectures are physically and socially connected. We also explore the demographic impacts by skills of migrants, directions of flow, and reasons of migration."

In this work, we develop a distributed estimation and statistical inference framework for the SAR model on a distributed system. We first propose a distributed network least squares approximation (DNLSA) method. This enables us to obtain a one-step estimator by taking a weighted average of local estimators on each worker. Afterwards, a refined two-step estimation is designed to further reduce the estimation bias. For statistical inference, we utilize a random projection method to reduce the expensive communication cost. Theoretically, we show the consistency and asymptotic normality of both the one-step and two-step estimators. In addition, we provide theoretical guarantee of the distributed statistical inference procedure. The theoretical findings and computational advantages are validated by several numerical simulations implemented on the Spark system. Lastly, an experiment on the Yelp dataset further illustrates the usefulness of the proposed methodology."

However, concerns about their default rate are increasing. This paper studies the psychological effects of sunshine on borrowers&rsquo; repayment behaviors. Using administrative datasets from China, we first show borrowers are 20.8% less likely to be delinquent if the sunshine duration is one standard deviation longer in the week of the repayment deadline. Furthermore, borrowers who signed up for solar panels on extremely sunny days have a persistently higher probability of delinquency. We rule out rational explanations and show the result is most consistent with behavioral bias, such as projection bias or salience. Overall, our results provide novel insights into the mechanisms of sunshine effects in renewable energy financing."

We demonstrate an appealing connection between LDPDC and a weighted group LASSO penalized least squares estimator. LDPDC improves the traditional principal component analysis by allowing for weak factors, whose signal strengths are relatively weak compared to the idiosyncratic component.&nbsp; Even when microstructure noise and asynchronous trading are present, LDPDC achieves a guarded positive definiteness without deteriorating convergence rates. To make LDPDC fully operational, we provide an extended simultaneous alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm to solve the resultant constrained convex minimization problem. We offer a data-driven algorithm to select involved tuning parameters in practice optimally. Empirically, we study the monthly high-frequency covariance structure of the stock constituents of the S&amp;P 500 index from 2008 to 2016, based on which we construct statistical high-frequency factor returns. We use all traded stocks from NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stock markets to construct 12 high-frequency firm characteristic-based economic factors. We further examine the out-of-sample performance of LDPDC through vast portfolio allocations, which deliver significantly reduced out-of-sample portfolio risk and enhanced Sharpe ratios. The success of our approach helps justify the usefulness of machine learning techniques in finance."

In this talk, I will discuss the recent development and its application in synthetic control.Synthetic control methods attract increasing attention for estimating the treatment effect on a single treated unit in comparative case studies. A synthetic control (SC) is a weighted average of control units built to match the treated unit&rsquo;s pre-treatment outcome trajectory, with weights typically estimated by regressing pre-treatment outcomes of the treated unit to those of the control units. However, it has been established that such regression estimators can fail to be consistent. In this paper, we introduce a proximal causal inference framework to formalize identification and inference for both the SC weights and the treatment effect on the treated. We also propose to view the difference in the post-treatment outcomes between the treated unit and the SC as a time series, which opens the door to a rich literature on time-series analysis for treatment effect estimation. We illustrate with an application to evaluation of the 1990 German Reunification.p class=""MsoNormal""span lang=""EN-US""o:p/o:p/span&nbsp;"

Our first segmentation step uses the eigenanalysis of a positive definite matrix to look for linear transformation of original high-dimensional functional time series such that the transformed curve series can be segmented into multiple groups of low-dimensional subseries, and the subseries in different groups are uncorrelated both contemporaneously and serially. Modelling each low-dimensional subseries separately will not lose the overall linear dynamical information, and at the same time, can avoid the overparametrization issue arisen from directly modelling original high-dimensional curve series. Our second dimension-reduction step estimates the finite-dimensional dynamical structure for each group of the transformed curve series that converts the problem of modelling low-dimensional functional time series to that of modelling vector time series. Efficient strategies can be implemented to predict vector time series groupwisely, which can then be converted back to predict groups of transformed curve subseries and finally original functional time series. We investigate the theoretical properties of our proposal when p diverges at an exponential rate of n. The superior finite-sample performance of the proposed methods is illustrated through both extensive simulations and three real datasets."

In this talk, we consider estimating sparse covariance functions for high-dimensional functional data, where the number of random functions p is comparable to, or even larger than the sample size n.Aided by the Hilbert--Schmidt norm of functions, we introduce a new class of functional thresholding operators that combine functional versions of thresholding and shrinkage, and propose the adaptive functional thresholding estimator by incorporating the variance effects of individual entries of the sample covariance function into functional thresholding. To handle the practical scenario where curves are partially observed with errors, we also develop a nonparametric smoothing approach to obtain the smoothed adaptive functional thresholding estimator and its binned implementation to accelerate the computation. We investigate the theoretical properties of our proposals when p grows exponentially with n under both fully and partially observed functional scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed adaptive functional thresholding estimators significantly outperform the competitors through extensive simulations and the functional connectivity analysis of two neuroimaging datasets."

We consider two measures for the deep tail characteristics: the extreme quantile function and the tail mean function defined as the conditional mean beyond a quantile level. Then we define the extreme quantile treatment effect (EQTE) and the extreme average treatment effect (EATE), which can be identified through the commonly adopted unconfoundedness condition and estimated with the aid of extreme value theory. Our limiting theory is for the EQTE and EATE processes indexed by a set of quantile levels and hence facilitates uniform inference. Simulations suggest that our method works well in finite samples and an empirical application illustrates its practical merit."

The idea involves constructing robust and structure-adaptive weights according to the estimated local sparsity levels. LAWS provides a unified framework for a broad range of spatial problems and is fully data-driven. It is shown that LAWS controls the FDR asymptotically under mild conditions on dependence. The finite sample performance is investigated using simulated data, which demonstrates that LAWS controls the FDR and outperforms existing methods in power.

We consider panel models where the outcome of a unit not only depends on its own characteristics and also the characteristics of other units (spillover effects). The effect of own characteristics can be unit-specific or homogeneous (common effects). We allow the linkage structure, i.e., which units interact with which, to be latent. Moreover, the structure and the spillover effects may both change at an unknown break point. To estimate the break point, linkage structure, and spillover and common effects, we solve a penalized least squares optimization and employ double machine learning procedures to improve the convergence and inference. We establish the super consistency of the break point estimator, which allows us to make inferences on other parameters as if the break point was known. We illustrate the theory via simulated and empirical data."

To explain this bias, various behavioral mechanisms have been proposed, among which regret aversion is a widely mentioned mechanism. We test this mechanism with an EEG-based neural measure on experienced regret that is exactly triggered by comparisons with counterfactual payoffs. The strength of the regret signal effectively predicts the magnitude of the pull-to-center bias out-of-sample, suggesting the avoidance of experienced regret as a fundamental driver of this behavioral bias. Algorithmic recommendation pushes subjects closer to optimal behavior, and its role is more significant for subjects who are more prone to experienced regret. Our study identifies a behavioral channel through which algorithm supports decision makers, and justifies the general relevance of neuro activities to operations management."

This statistical limit to arbitrage widens the bounds within which true alphas can survive in equilibrium relative to the arbitrage pricing theory (APT) in which arbitrageurs are endowed with perfect knowledge of the return distribution. We derive the optimal Sharpe ratio achievable by any feasible arbitrage strategy, and illustrate in a simple model how this Sharpe ratio varies with the strength and sparsity of alpha signals, which characterize the difficulty of arbitrageurs&rsquo; learning problem. Furthermore, we design an &ldquo;all-weather&rdquo; arbitrage strategy that achieves this optimal Sharpe ratio regardless of the conditions of alpha signals. We also show how arbitrageurs can adopt multiple-testing, LASSO, and Ridge methods to achieve optimality under distinct conditions of alpha signals, respectively. Our empirical analysis of equity returns shows that all strategies we consider achieve a moderately low Sharpe ratio out of sample, in spite of a considerably higher infeasible Sharpe ratio, consistent with absence of feasible near-arbitrage opportunities and relevance of statistical limits to arbitrage.&nbsp;"

Improving this observability leads to two strategic effects on information acquisition:(i)the pricing effect arises from interactions between investors and the market maker, which can encourage or discourage information acquisition; and (ii) the competition effect concerns interactions amongst investors and always encourages information acquisition. We apply our theory to study voluntary and mandatory disclosures of corporate site visits. When the competition effect dominates, investors are likely to voluntarily disclose their visits. When the pricing effect dominates, mandatory disclosure is effective in changing information acquisition and market quality."

A cumulative sum (cusum) process is established by using all components in the gradient of the check function, which is further modified by (1) replacing the weighting functions with dimension reduction ability, and (2) incorporating an orthogonal projection onto the tangent space of nuisance parameters in order to eliminate the uncertainty of preliminary parameter estimation. Besides, this projection is also able to facilitate an attractive multiplier bootstrap procedure for the computation of critical values. We then introduce several Cram&eacute;r-von Mises-type test statistics with convenient closed-form expressions. The asymptotic properties of the proposed test statistics are investigated under the null, the alternative, and a sequence of local alternatives converging to the null at the rate, respectively.

For panel data in economics or finance may require heterogeneous model selection for each (potentially unknown) clusters the observations naturally form. We invent a novel approach to solving the joint problem of observation clustering and model selection.&nbsp;Our Clustered Bayesian Model (CBM) combines tree-based supervised clustering algorithms and Bayesian modeling with the spike-and-slab prior distributions.First, cross-sectional observations are clustered recursively into leaves by a tree that grows according to the marginal likelihood jointly for all selected leaf models. Second, observations in each leaf fit a model separately with uncommon variables using data in&nbsp; all periods. Third, the Bayesian model allows time-varying coefficients driven by observation subject characteristics under modest computational costs.&nbsp;We apply CBM to the (imbalanced) panel of individual stock returns for estimating and selecting observable factor models. CBM splits cross-sectional stock returns by firm characteristics and selects potentially distinct factor models for each leaf clusters. Empirically, we find most asset clusters can be explained by the list of published factors, but some have significant alphas. CBM provides a graphical tree-leaf path with firm characteristics to analyze these mispriced stocks. Finally, we provide Bayesian inference on factor usefulness and the fundamental and macroeconomic sources of mispricing clusters."

Our model aims to explain the conditional mean of the return from the conditional distribution of the return, which is approximated by a step distribution function constructed from conditional quantiles of the return. To study conditional quantiles of the return, we propose a new conditional quantile variational autoencoder (CQVAE) network. The CQVAE network specifies a factor structure for conditional quantiles with latent factors learned from a VAE network and nonlinear factor loadings learned from a &quot;multi-head&quot; network. Under the CQVAE network, we allow the observed covariates such as asset characteristics to guide the structure of latent factors and factor loadings. Furthermore, we provide a two-step estimation procedure for the CQVAE network. Finally, we apply our CQVAE asset pricing model to analyze a 60-year US equity return data set. Compared with the benchmark conditional autoencoder model, the CQVAE model not only delivers much larger values of out-of-sample total and predictive R^2s, but also earns at least 30.9% higher values of Sharpe ratios for both long-short and long-only portfolios."

The oracle inequalities for the two proposed aggregated forecasting strategies are derived. We show that the exponential reweighting based strategy enjoys promising Kullback--Leibler risk bound adaptation in the sense that it automatically achieves the best possible performance among all the candidate forecasting procedures up to an additive term that will vanish as the within-subject sample size increases. Whereas, under the quadratic risk function, we find that the exponential reweighting based strategy may not be able to achieve the similar adaptation property but our quadratic reweighting based strategy can overcome this deficiency and yield promising risk bound adaptation. Under mild conditions, we also establish the risk bound properties of the two proposed procedures in the presence of pre-screening. Simulation studies and a real-world example in analyzing television viewers' binary decision sequence of watching drama episodes verify the superiority of our methods over existing model selection methods."

Due to the limitation of the existing methods for factor analysis that deal with only continuous variables, in this paper, we develop a generalized factor model, a corresponding algorithm and theory for ultra-high dimensional mixed types of variables where both the sample size $n$ and variable dimension $p$ could diverge to infinity. Specifically, to solve the computational problem arising from the non-linearity and mixed types, we develop a two-step algorithm so that each update can be carried out in parallel across variables and samples by using an existing package. Theoretically, we establish the rate of convergence for the estimators of factors and loadings in the presence of nonlinear structure accompanied with mixed-type variables when both $n$ and $p$ diverge to infinity. Moreover, since the correct specification of the number of factors is crucial to both the theoretical and the empirical validity of factor models, we also develop a criterion based on a penalized loss to consistently estimate the number of factors under the framework of a generalized factor model. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over the existing ones, we conducted extensive simulation studies and also applied it to the analysis of the NFBC1966 dataset and a cardiac arrhythmia dataset, resulting in more predictive and interpretable estimators for loadings and factors than the existing factor model."

This work takes a different perspective and investigates the null hypotheses that the two support sets are equal. This formulation of the testing problem is motivated by the fact that in many applications where the two parameter vectors being compared are both sparse, we might be more concerned about the detection of differential sparsity structures rather than the difference in parameter magnitudes. A general approach to problems of this type is developed via a novel double thresholding (DT) filter. The DT filter first constructs a sequence of pairs of ranking statistics that fulfill global symmetry properties, and then chooses two data-driven thresholds along the ranking to simultaneously control the false discovery rate (FDR) and maximize the number of rejections. Several applications of the methodology are given, including tests for large-scale correlation matrices, high-dimensional linear models and Gaussian graphical models."

As a central plank of PM, portfolio selection by expected utility maximization (EUM) faces uncontrollable estimation and optimization errors in ultrahigh-dimensional scenarios. Past strategies for high-dimensional PM mainly concern only large-cap companies and select many stocks, making PM impractical. We propose a sample-average approximation-based portfolio strategy to tackle the aforementioned difficulties with cardinality constraints. Our strategy bypasses the estimation of mean and covariance, the Chinese walls in high-dimensional scenarios. Empirical results on S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 show that an appropriate number of carefully chosen assets leads to better out-of-sample mean variance efficiency. On Russell 2000, our best portfolio profits twice more than the best mean-variance portfolio but reduces the maximum drawdown by 47%. While no more than 30 assets can form diversified portfolios for S&amp;P 500, near 100 assets are needed for Russell 2000 due to higher volatility and lower signal-noise ratios. Our strategy balances the trade-off among the return, the risk, and the number of assets with cardinality constraints. Therefore, we provide a theoretically sound and computationally efficient strategy to make PM practical in the growing global financial market."

Empirically, we find that the tests reject six well-known asset pricing models at the stock level, as well as recently developed machine learning models. The economic test provides a real time profitable trading strategy that exploits mispricing, and the mispricing patterns are similar across all the models. The significant profitability is unexplained by limits-to-arbitrage, prospect theory, and expectation extrapolation, suggesting that new factors are needed to better understand the cross section of stock returns.&nbsp;"

The framework allows buyers and sellers to have heterogenous benefits from using platforms for transactions, and additionally, buyers to have idiosyncratic preferences over using the different platforms. We highlight that multihoming in participation is not the only thing driving market outcomes; one has to also take into account buyers' preferences over which platform they transact on. We show how key primitives such as the number of platforms, the fraction of buyers that find multihoming costly, the value of transactions for buyers and sellers, and the degree of buyer heterogeneity jointly determine the level and structure of platform fees."

With the aid of new reformulation, we propose a new test statistic and show that its asymptotic distribution is $\chi^2$ distribution whose degree of freedom does not depend on the unknown population distribution. We further conduct power analysis under local alternative hypotheses. In addition, we study how to control the false discovery rate of the proposed $\chi^2$ tests, which are correlated, to identify important predictors under a model-free framework. To this end, we propose a multiple testing procedure and establish its theoretical guarantees.

In this talk, we will review different subsampling techniques for different models from linear model, to generalized linear model, and to estimation equations. If the data volume is so large that nonuniform subsampling probabilities cannot be calculated all at once, subsampling with replacement is infeasible to implement. This problem is solved by using a new subsampling without replacement, called Poisson subsampling. To deal with the situation that the full data are stored in different blocks or at multiple locations, a distributed subsampling framework is developed, in which statistics are computed simultaneously on smaller partitions of the full data. Finally, the proposed strategies are illustrated and evaluated through numerical experiments on both simulated and real data sets."

Utilizing a transaction-level data on income and donation dynamics from a high-income economy in Asia, this paper shows that higher income uncertainty predicts more donations, especially for religious donations, and for negative income uncertainty. This pattern is inconsistent with existing explanations of donation, and we pinpoint evidence that our results are explained by a &ldquo;wishful thinking&rdquo; or &ldquo;spiritual insurance&rdquo; channel. Indeed we find that donating to religious organizations crowds out demand for market-based insurance products. Our results suggest that the &ldquo;spiritual insurance&rdquo; channel of religion can be influential for the donation and insurance markets even outside of underdeveloped markets."

The key feature is that a large set of noisy measurements are linked with the underlying latent confounders through an unknown, possibly nonlinear factor structure. The main building block is a local principal subspace approximation procedure that combines K-nearest neighbors matching and principal component analysis. Estimators of many causal parameters, including average treatment effects and counterfactual distributions, are constructed based on doubly-robust score functions. Large-sample properties of these estimators are established, which only require relatively mild conditions on the principal subspace approximation. The results are illustrated with an empirical application studying the effect of political connections on stock returns of financial firms, and a Monte Carlo experiment. The main technical and methodological results regarding the general local principal subspace approximation method may be of independent interest."

We find that bank systemic risk will increase in the short run with negative investor sentiment. Both individual risk and interconnectedness risk, which are two components of systemic risk indicator, are asymmetrically correlated with negative sentiment inducing a stronger short-run effect than positive sentiment. We also test these relationships in long-run and obtain a reversal effect. The change on perception of positive investor sentiment will change the reality of bank balance sheet activities, e.g., expansion in more risky assets or engaging in more homogeneous business, which in hence reduces the stability of banking sector."

Our estimates provide robust evidence of an overall increase in the month-over-month growth rate in flood policies to the innovations in the news coverage (i.e., the unexpected change in coverage intensity), mainly driven by responses from the non-coastal counties. Sociodemographic heterogeneity in responses is also found. We also pay close attention to confirmation bias, which provides important information to assess whether individuals interpret climate news from a news outlet that shares the same political view differently."

In this problem,&nbsp; not all components of the random vector are observed at the same time and the measurement errors are latent variables, leading to major challenges besides high data dimensionality. We first propose a&nbsp; new covariance matrix estimator in this context with appropriate localization and thresholding, and then conduct a series of comprehensive theoretical investigations of the proposed estimator. By developing a new technical device integrating the high-frequency data feature with the conventional notion of alfont face=""楷体""span style=""font-size: 14px;""pha/span/font-mixing, our analysis successfully accommodates the challenging serial dependence in the measurement errors. Our theoretical analysis establishes the minimax optimal convergence rates associated with two commonly used loss functions.&nbsp; We then establish cases when the proposed localized estimator with thresholding achieves the minimax optimal convergence rates. Considering that the variances and covariances can be small in reality, we conduct a second-order theoretical analysis that further disentangles the dominating bias in the estimator. A bias-corrected estimator is then proposed to ensure its practical finite sample performance. To accommodate jumps, we extensively analyze our estimator in a setting with both jumps and stochastic volatility and show that they are reasonably robust. We illustrate the promising empirical performance of the proposed estimator with extensive simulation studies and a real data analysis."

Using registered corporate trademarks as a proxy for new product creation, we find that domestic firms react to strong foreign competition by reducing new trademark applications. The negative effect is more pronounced for firms operating in more competitive industries, financially more constrained firms, and firms exposed to higher predation risk. Moreover, the reduction in the quantity of new trademarks due to fierce foreign competition is accompanied by a decline in the economic value of newly registered trademarks. Further analysis shows that firms adopt heterogeneous trademarking strategies in response to foreign competition depending on their industry positions. Taken together, our findings reveal the role of foreign competition in shaping domestic firms&rsquo; product development strategies.&nbsp;"

Combined with high-resolution satellite imagery data of forest loss, we adopt national longitudinal datasets of PAR participation at both the county and individual levels, with multiple cross-sections before and after the launch of the program. Our sample includes 1263 participating counties covering 95% of the entire population relocated by PAR, together with 484 uninvolved neighboring counties for comparison. We find that the PAR program significantly reduces deforestation in the participating counties. Furthermore, the migrated individuals mitigate their forest clearing behavior after resettlement, even for those whose move-in places are still in rural villages. This study provides fresh evidence that China&rsquo;s resettlement program aiming at poverty alleviation also contributes to forest conservation. It highlights the effectiveness of resettlement as an alternative strategy to combat deforestation along with poverty, by not only physically moving the poor away from the forest but also changing their livelihood strategies and life styles."

A tricky aspect of the problem is that opening up business has an immediate positive effect in the economic metrics, but a delayed and lingering negative effect on the health costs. We formulate a continuous objective function to capture this tricky aspect, and find conditions under which these two components become exchangeable. We obtain closed-form solutions of the optimal control policy. The structural solutions rule out many sub-optimal decisions, while at the same time offering a rich variety of solutions depending on parameters."

In this paper we propose a semiparametric family of Dynamic Functional-coefficient Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (DyFAST) models to address the difficulties to overcome in modelling and analysis. The DyFAST models at least own two significant features. (i) The functional (or varying) coefficient structures that are popular in traditional statistical analysis of i.i.d. and time series data are extended to specify the autoregressive smooth coefficients depending both on a concerned regime and location. The DyFAST models can hence not only characterise the dynamic regime-switching nature but also adapt to the location-wide non-stationarity in real spatio-temporal data. (ii) Two semiparametric smoothing schemes are proposed to model the dynamic neighbouring-time interaction effects with irregular locations incorporated by (spatial) weight matrices. The first scheme that is popular in spatial econometrics supposes that the weight matrix is pre-specified either by experts or by prior information of spatial locations. In practice, the weight matrix may be specified in different ways by data location features. Although model selection for an optimal weight matrix among the candidates is popular, it may suffer from loss of features of different weight matrices. Our second scheme is thus to suggest a weight matrix fusion to let data combine or select the candidates. Accordingly, different semiparametric smoothing procedures are developed for estimation. Both theoretical properties and Monte Carlo simulations are investigated. The empirical application to an EU energy market dataset further demonstrates the usefulness with interesting findings by the DyFAST models."

We show their point-identification under an index sufficiency assumption on the unobserved heterogeneity, even when the error distribution is unspecified. This assumption does not impose parametric restrictions on the unobserved heterogeneity. We then construct a three-step semiparametric estimator for the APE. In the first step, we estimate the common parameters using either a conditional logit or smoothed maximum score estimator. In the second step, we estimate the conditional expectation of the outcomes given the indices and a generated regressor that depends on first-step estimates. In the third step, we average derivatives of this conditional expectation to obtain a partial mean that estimates the APE. We show that this proposed three-step APE estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. We evaluate its finite-sample properties in Monte Carlo simulations. We then illustrate our estimator in a study of determinants of married women&rsquo;s labor supply."

A conservative decision maker, upon observing the committee members&rsquo; votes, decides whether to adopt the change. We show that the DM can be persuaded to adopt the change if and only if she can be persuaded under the unanimity rule. In general, when the DM becomes more conservative, she in equilibrium asks for a higher level of consensus among the committee members in favoring the change. Our results thus provide a rationale for the use of unanimity rule, despite its poor performance in information aggregation (Feddersen and Pesendorfer 1998). The results also imply that when considering whether the DM can be persuaded, it is without loss to focus on symmetric voting equilibria. We discuss why our continuous-signal model and the discrete-signal models (Battaglini 2017; Gradwohl and Feddersen 2018) in the literature produce contrasting results."

The first paper proposes to model and forecast realized volatility (RV) using the fractional Ornstein&ndash;Uhlenbeck (fO&ndash;U) process with a general Hurst parameter, H. A two-stage method is introduced for estimating parameters in the fO&ndash;U process based on discrete-sampled observations. All estimators have closed-form expressions and are easy to implement. A large sample theory of the proposed estimators is derived. We apply the model and the method to the logarithmic daily RV series of stock indexes in the US. The empirical findings suggest that H is much smaller than 1/2, indicating that the RV series have rough sample paths, and that the mean reversion parameter takes a small positive number, showing that the RV series are stationary but have slow mean reversion. In the second paper, we propose a revised rough volatility model with time-varying parameters to fit the RV series of crypto-currencies. A new estimation strategy is designed. Compared to many alternative models, including the ARFIMA, HAR, and HARQ models, the proposed model shows superior performance in out-of-sample forecasting."

However, their studies focused on stationary time series models, in which the identification of the first break depends on the magnitude and the duration of the break, and a testing procedure is needed to assist the estimation of the remaining breaks in subsamples split by the break points found earlier. In this paper, we focus on nonstationary multiple-break autoregressive models. Unlike the stationary case, we show that the duration of a break does not affect whether it will be identified first. Rather, it depends on the stochastic order of magnitude of signal strength of the break under the case of constant break magnitude and also the square of the magnitude of the break under the case of shrinking break magnitude. Since the subsamples usually have different stochastic orders in nonstationary autoregressive models with breaks, one can therefore determine which break will be identified first. We apply this finding to the models proposed in Phillips and Yu (2011) and Phillips et al. (2011, 2015a, 2015b). We propose an estimation procedure as well as the asymptotic theory for the model. Some extensions to more general models are provided, and the hypothesis test with the null hypothesis being the unit root model is examined.

One is named &quot;virtual permutation&quot;, due to professor Knottnerus, with most details presented in the monograpch &quot;Sample Survey Theory: Some Pythagorean Perspectives&quot;. The other is proposed recently by the author, named &quot;imaginary census&quot;, for which a key element is the imaginary census matrix, recording the exact sampling trajectory of each draw without replacement, until all population units were pretended to be sampled out. Both provide interesting supplement to Neyman's conventional framework. In particular, both provides insight into relationship of simple random sampling with and without replacement."

Individuals frequently differ in their endowments, productivities, their shares of rewards, and the positions they occupy in social hierarchies. In this talk, we discuss the effects of inequality on cooperation and coordination based on asymmetric threshold public goods games. In general, such games including a free-riding equilibrium in which no one contributes and a set of cooperative equilibria in which the total contribution equals to the threshold. We use a behavioral experiment to study three different scenarios: full equality, endowment inequality, and productivity inequality. For the given parameters, experiments find that endowment inequality is more of an obstacle to cooperation than productivity inequality. Interestingly, in successful groups, different subjects tend to make similar relative contributions (irrespective of their absolute endowments or their productivities). These results highlight some of the nontrivial effects that arise when heterogeneous populations aim to reach a consensus."

We find that firms suspected of manipulating real activities in trying to meet earnings benchmarks exhibit a higher likelihood and frequency of product recalls. Other evidence implies that high earnings pressure induces managers to manipulate real activities, resulting in more product quality failures. In cross-sectional results consistent with expectations, we find that the impact of exploiting real activities to attain earnings benchmarks on product recalls intensifies for firms whose managers have stronger incentives to manage earnings and subsides for firms subject to greater customer power and firms with more growth opportunities. Additional analysis shows that suspected benchmark targeting also raises the severity of product recalls."

The principal seeks the cheapest mechanism to incentivize the agents to exert costly efforts. In our setting, the principal chooses the work sequence and the rewards to the agents upon success. Whereas the agents&rsquo; actions are hidden to the principal, they may be observed among the agents given the internal information that is determined by the network and sequence. We show that under complementarity, the transparency of the agents&rsquo; actions can reduce their incentive costs. Moreover, the effectiveness of transparency decreases as an action becomes more transparent. In the optimal sequence, the agents work sequentially, with more important agents working later. The agents in later stages effectively monitor their preceding peers and have higher incentive costs. When the team consists of multiple sub-teams, larger sub-teams are allocated towards both ends of the optimal sequence, and only a small fraction of the agents will serve as monitors. For several typical networks, simple algorithms are offered to explicitly characterize the optimum."

By projecting the observation matrix onto the row or column factor space, we simplify factor analysis for matrix series to that for a lower-dimensional tensor. This method also reduces the magnitudes of the idiosyncratic error components, thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio, because the projection matrix linearly filters the idiosyncratic error matrix. We theoretically prove that the projected estimators of the factor loading matrices achieve faster convergence rates than existing estimators under similar conditions. Asymptotic distributions of the projected estimators are also presented. A novel iterative procedure is given to specify the pair of row and column factor numbers. Extensive numerical studies verify the empirical performance of the projection method. Two real examples in finance and macroeconomics reveal factor patterns across rows and columns, which coincide with financial, economic, or geographical interpretations."

In Experiment I, individuals are randomly assigned to a control group, a free installment group, and a matching group. We find that a free installment for the first month contribution increases the pension participation from 8 percent to 34 percent, and increases the pension contribution by 4 times. A 100% matching for the first month contribution also increases the participation and contributions, but the effect is smaller. We show that the results can be explained by that free Installment group attracts more present bias agents, and present bias agents are more likely to participate in the pension when they do not need to pay first month contribution. In Experiment II, we further compare a full commitment pension including only one commitment account with a partial commitment pension contract including a liquid account and a commitment account. Individuals are randomly assigned to four groups: full commitment pension with high withdraw penalty, partial commitment pension with low withdraw penalty, partial commitment pension with high withdraw penalty, and a choice group in which they choose full commitment or partial commitment with high withdraw penalty. We find that, partial commitment pension with high withdraw penalty and the choice group have 9.9 percentage points and 7.7 percentage points more participation compared to full commitment pension, respectively. We show that high commitment contract attracts more sophisticated agents, and higher degree of commitment increase the pension participation more for sophisticated agents. These results are consistent with the theory of optimal illiquidity.&nbsp;"

MCB identifies two nested models (upper and lower confidence bound models) containing the true model at a given level of confidence, whose width and composition can be the measure of the model selection uncertainty. Several graphical tools are further proposed. These include the model uncertainty curve (MUC), G-plots, H-plots, and model selection deviation (MSD), to visualize the distribution of the selected model and the variability of model selection. The proposed assessment method and visualization tools enable the practitioner to evaluate the overall model selection uncertainty and to compare different model selection procedures.

The model can be applied to study social interactions in activities that require the participation of mutual friends, or when the strength of interaction effects depends endogenously on the local activity levels. We provide conditions under which the model admits a unique Nash equilibrium. The parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood and we show that the estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal, using recently developed limit theorems for spatial near-epoch dependent processes. The finite sample properties of the estimator are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. As an empirical application, we apply the model to examine peer effects in classrooms using data from several primary schools in China. We find that the strength of peer influences in cognitive outcomes depends on the levels of cognitive abilities among friends, and this can be strengthened by encouraging students completing tasks in teams."

We argue that this liquidity management practice can transmit and concentrate non-fundamental demand shocks from fund flows onto the Treasuries the funds hold, leading to fragility in Treasury prices. We find that Treasuries held more by bond funds tend to exhibit high return comovement during downside markets, negatively skewed returns, and frequent liquidity co-jumps, compared with Treasuries with little fund ownership. We address endogeneity concerns by exploiting the 2003 mutual fund scandal as an shock to fund ownership. Such mechanism can help explain the COVID-19 Treasury market turmoil in March 2020."

In the past, most industrial land was transacted through negotiations that usually lacked transparency and competition. Since 2007, the central government has imposed public auction for transactions of industrial land. This paper investigates whether the 2007 auction reform has improved industrial land allocation efficiency by focusing on the allocation of local land to different industries. We develop a theoretical framework to understand the land allocation mechanisms before and after the reform. Utilizing three comprehensive data sets of new industrial establishments, land transactions and nighttime lights, the empirical analysis finds that, in sharp contrast to the pre-reform period, more land was allocated to industries with local comparative advantage during the post-reform period, and this effect is more pronounced in the localities with higher reform stringency levels. It suggests that the reform has promoted the spatial clustering of firms from industries which have close connections to each other and hence facilitated the formation of a more efficient local industrial composition.

In practice, however, the similarity condition is difficult to meet or is often violated. In this paper, under the framework of exponential family with heterogeneous source models, the related models are precisely combined by bran-new measures: linear correlation ratios between the target model and source models. Based on this type of combinations, the precision transfer likelihood is constructed by the target likelihood combined with the transferred likelihoods from the source models. Methodologically, some techniques are suggested for transferring the information from simple source models to a relatively complex target model. Theoretically, the asymptotic properties, including the standard convergence rate, are achieved, even for the case where the source models are unrelated to the target model. It can be seen from the theories and numerical results that the inference on the target model is significantly improved by the information from source models, and it is somewhat surprising that phenomenon of Stein's paradox is illustrated."

More recent signs have stronger impacts on imbalance. The subsequent performance of this trading behavior is poor, indicating individual investors in Taiwan make suboptimal decisions, and their trade is unlikely to be information-based. Thus, the liquidity provision explanation in the literature is not applicable to our sample, and our results suggest behavioral reasons.

Under the &ldquo;dual track system&rdquo; (DTS), rural farmers were obligated to fulfill government procurement before selling to the market, whereas urban consumers enjoyed de facto subsidies to agricultural products. Using a neoclassical general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms and workers and input-output linkage, this paper exploits historical data and analyzes allocation, prices, and the formation of markets in China during this DTS period. Theoretically, while DTS will distort the resources allocation between rural and urban (misallocation effect), it selects workers and farmers in the rural (selection effect). What is more, comparing to the economy under Soviet-style big bang reform, DTS activates industrialization by providing intermediate goods with lower-than-market price (activation effect). Quantitatively, directly switching to market economy in 1978 would decrease total output by 4.5% as the activation effect dominates. On the intensive margin, reform on DTS ( procurement price was getting closer to market price ) had contributed to total output by 4.4% from 1978 to 1992."

Under the null hypothesis that grounded in no-arbitrage, the asset prices evolve as a semimartingale that exhibits stochastic volatility and jumps; under the alternative, a pricing error that reflects various market frictions is added to the semimartingale part. Using high-frequency data, we derive limit theorems for the proposed testing statistic when the asset price follows a general semimartingale, leading to formal tests for the presence of pricing errors. Our test has power against a broad class of alternative hypotheses where the pricing errors could be endogenous, nonstationary, seasonal and serially correlated. Moreover, the observation times are allowed to be stochastic under both the null and the alternative hypotheses. The testing procedure is uniformly valid under both the infill (with fixed time span) and non-infill, long span asymptotic frameworks. It thus finds broad applications in time series analysis on market microstructure, asset pricing and macroeconomics where the underlying time series has a permanent and a transitory component."

We follow 58,345 borrowers from a peer-to-peer lending platform to study how women and men react to enforcement mechanisms differently. In the experiment, borrowers are randomized into treatments where they receive different text messages urging for timely repayment if they have loans due the next day. Compared to a reminder message, the messages inducing social pressures and financial incentives reduce the overdue rate for both genders. However, women are more responsive to messages producing social pressures, while men are more responsive to financial incentives. The results imply the potential importance of a gender-dependent mechanism to enhance compliance."

We examine a dynamic delegation problem where a principal needs to decide on a project with uncertain profitability. A biased agent, who is initially as uninformed as the principal, privately learns about the profitability over time and communicates to the principal. We formulate learning delegation as a dynamic mechanism design problem and characterize the optimal delegation scheme. Our results show that private learning gives rise to the tradeoff between how much information to acquire and how promptly the acquired information is reflected in the decision. We discuss implications on learning delegation for distinct organizations."

Quantifying their welfare implication requires not only knowing where firms from different countries locate production, but the destinations of what they produce. Data on bilateral trade and multinational production do not fully identify multinational activities without additional assumptions. I develop a model that allows a complete range of multinational activities, including selling only in the host country (horizontal FDI), selling only in the country of origin (vertical FDI), and selling to third countries (export platform FDI). Using the model and the available data, I bound outcomes from various counterfactual scenarios without imposing specific assumptions about multinationals. As a theoretical matter I show that, for any country, gains from openness (from both trade and multinational activity) are at a maximum with horizontal FDI and at a minimum with vertical FDI. Empirical results show that a wide range of outcomes are consistent with the data; for example, the welfare gains from openness in Germany range between 4.5% and 14.5%. While the incompleteness of the data leaves open a wide range of outcomes, what data are available still bring clear judgement on policy evaluation, for example, penalizing U.S. multinationals for offshoring never benefits the United States."

We explore its behavioral consequences from the perspective of decision fatigue&mdash;the decline in decision quality due to an increased number of patients and treatment decisions. We use administrative data from over 250,000 visits to an emergency department to analyze how decision fatigue affects physician decision-making and patient outcomes. Controlling for various confounding factors, we find that every 10 patients the physician had previously treated during a shift lowered the index patient&rsquo;s inpatient admission probability by 10.6%, reduced the number of task orders by 10.3%, and shortened the length of stay by 15.7%. Subsequently, both patient revisit rates and mortality rates increased, by 3.0% and 13.3%, respectively. Furthermore, we find that the observed consequences of physician decision-making can be alleviated by taking a break and by accumulated medical experience. These findings suggest that decision fatigue erodes the quality of physician decision-making and impairs patient outcomes, which have important implications on the long-standing debate regarding regulations for healthcare professionals and excessive physician workload.&nbsp;"

Large state space leads to large number of moments, rendering optimization via exhaustive search computationally challenging. We propose a new multi-step estimation procedure and demonstrate via extensive simulation that it is extremely fast to compute. Theoretically our estimator selects the correct matching with probability approaching one and consistently estimates the payoff function. We propose an asymptotically uniformly valid and easy-to-implement test for the linear hypothesis on the payoff function."

As a result, there may be no best ranking, due to intransitive cycles. This paper shows how to tell when a best ranking exists, and that when it exists, it is indeed the natural ranking. When this best does not exist, an alternative second-best group ranking strategy is proposed, which resembles actual airline boarding policies.&nbsp;"

We model the time variation in key parameters, using a hidden Markov switching process, and derive the corresponding pricing formula for European options using an analytical approximation method. The proposed framework is easy to estimate and implement, as inferences about regimes are deduced from realized volatility measures. The estimation results indicates that investor shows two distinct attitudes towards volatility-specific risk within different market states. We conduct an extensive empirical application on S&amp;P 500 index options from 1990 to 2019 and find that the newly proposed model outperforms competing methods. Both in-sample and out-of-sample."

I analyze the impact of electricity interconnection in the presence of intermittent renewables, such as wind and solar power, on renewable capacity and carbon emissions using a two-country model. I find that in the first-best, interconnection decreases investments in renewable capacity and exacerbates carbon emissions if the Pigouvian carbon price is low. Conversely, interconnection increases renewable capacity and reduces carbon emissions for a high carbon price. Moreover, the intermittency of renewables generates an insurance gain from interconnection, which also implies that some renewable capacity is optimally curtailed in some states of nature when the carbon price is high. The curtailment rate and the corresponding carbon emissions increase for more positively correlated intermittency. I calibrate the model using data from the European Union electricity market and simulate the outcome of expanding interconnection between Germany-Poland and France-Spain. I find that given the current level of carbon tax, the interconnection may increase carbon emissions."

The diffusion K-means constructs a random walk on the similarity graph with vertices as data points randomly sampled on the manifolds and edges as similarities given by a kernel that captures the local geometry of manifolds. The diffusion K-means is a multi-scale clustering tool that is suitable for data with non-linear and non-Euclidean geometric features in mixed dimensions. Given the number of clusters, we propose a polynomial-time convex relaxation algorithm via the semidefinite programming (SDP) to solve the diffusion K-means. In addition, we also propose a nuclear norm regularized SDP that is adaptive to the number of clusters. In both cases, we show that exact recovery of the SDPs for diffusion K-means can be achieved under suitable between-cluster separability and within-cluster connectedness of the submanifolds, which together quantify the hardness of the manifold clustering problem. We further propose the localized diffusion K-means by using the local adaptive bandwidth estimated from the nearest neighbors. We show that exact recovery of the localized diffusion K-means is fully adaptive to the local probability density and geometric structures of the underlying submanifolds.&nbsp;span style=""font-family: 宋体; font-size: 14px;""说明：演讲嘉宾线上进行讲座，预约成功的同学请到经济楼D136观看，其他师生也可以选择线上参加，参会方式将以邮件形式发送给师生。/span"

In this paper, we study how a significant relaxation of internal migration restrictions affects labor market outcomes of both incumbent migrants and natives, exploiting the 2014 Hukou reform in China. This reform substantially removed the migration barriers of cities with an urban population below 5 million (non megacities) but kept the migration barriers in megacities almost unchanged. Using a difference in differences method, we find migrants&lsquo; wages in non megacities experience approximately a 7.3% decline relative to that in megacities after the policy shock. The negative effects are stronger among older, less educated, and blue collar incumbent migrants. By contrast, the policy change has non-negative impacts on the wages and labor participation rates of the natives in non-megacities. These results suggest the downward wage pressure imposed by an inflow of migrants falls primarily on incumbent migrants rather than on natives."

In this study, we introduce an integrative procedure that can be used to explore the information regarding group and sparsity structures for high-dimensional and heterogeneous stratified models. Further, we propose $K$-regression modeling as a hybrid of complex and simple models exhibiting arbitrary dependence on the stratification features, but linear dependence on other variables. $K$-regression models preeminently exhibit the following features:(i) they are essentially non-parametric with respect to the stratified feature, and parametric linearly effects in other variables with potentially integrative pattern because the effects and the corresponding sparsity structures can be the same for the stratifications in common groups but vary across different groups; (ii) the devised $K$-regression algorithm can automatically integrate the stratifications pertaining to common regression model and simultaneously estimate the corresponding effects simultaneously; (iii) the proposal quickly recovers the subpopulation and sparsity structure of the $K$-regression models within massive and high-dimensional stratifications; (iv) the resulting estimators exhibit two-layer oracle properties, i.e., the oracle estimator obtained using the known group and sparsity structures is the local minimizer of the objective function with high probability. The stratification-specific bootstrap (SSB) sampling scheme was developed to improve the integration accuracy. Furthermore, the simulation studies provide supportive evidence that the newly proposed method performs appropriately in case of finite samples; a real data example has been provided for illustration."

This macro factor exhibits salient counter-cyclical dynamics, produces an out-of-sample R2 of 3.4% for predicting quarterly stock market excess returns from 1984 to 2018, and dominates a wide array of commonly used macro and financial predictors. Relative to the short-term macro forecasts, the long-term macro forecasts provide incremental information about the time variations of long-horizon equity premiums. A dynamic trading strategy that employs market timing in return and volatility jointly based on the factor can yield a significant and sizable utility gain to a mean-variance investor. Our evidence reveals a direct and tight link between the ex-ante expectation of the macroeconomic condition and the time variation of the equity premium at the business cycle frequency. The driving force of the predictive power stems from a cyclical component of the equity premium that negatively covaries with expected macroeconomic conditions, especially during recessions."

Using data publicized by the country&rsquo;s Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS), we identify in real-time polluting firms that are violating the national emission standards, and randomly intervene by making differentiated appeals against such violations. We find that privately informing (or appealing to) the government about pollution violations has limited impact, while publicly appealing to the government on social media significantly improves environmental regulation enforcement: the firm is 50% less likely to engage in future pollution violations, and reduces its average air and water emission concentrations by 8-10%. Exploiting additional features of our experimental design, we further examine why making the appeals public is key to improving accountability: public pressure not only incentivizes the government to enforce regulation, but also serves as a &ldquo;leverage&rdquo; to help the government ensure that firms comply with regulation. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that encouraging citizen participation could lead to significant improvements in China&rsquo;s aggregate environmental quality."

To justify that the dividend pay day effect captures investors&rsquo; demand for dividends, we conduct two tests and find: (1) young investors are more likely to reinvest their dividends on dividend-paying stocks; (2) stocks more heavily held by mutual funds in 401K retirement accounts experience a larger price pressure on dividend payment days. Based on our stock-level measure of dividend demand, we draw two implications. First, we find that the dividend pay day effect can significantly and negatively predict corporate dividend payouts. This effect is weaker when firm managers are more overconfident, suggesting that firms have a dividend catering behavior. Second, consistent with &ldquo;reaching for dividends,&rdquo; the dividend pay day effect is stronger when interest rates are higher. We use the COVID-19 pandemic to pin down the causal link between interest rates and the dividend pay day effect. The impact of interest rates on the dividend pay day effect suggests that monetary policy affects financial markets through the price pressure on dividend payments."

That is, moment conditions including moment functions that are local to zero uniformly over the parameter set. We show that the relevant moment selection procedure of Hall et al. (2007) is inconsistent in this setting as it does not explicitly account for the rate of convergence of parameter estimation of the candidate models which may vary. We introduce a new moment selection procedure based on a criterion that automatically accounts for both the convergence rate of the candidate model&rsquo;s parameter estimate and the entropy of the estimator&rsquo;s asymptotic distribution. The benchmark estimator that we consider is the two-step efficient generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator which is known to be efficient in this framework as well. A family of penalization functions is introduced that guarantees the consistency of the selection procedure. The finite sample performance of the proposed method is assessed through Monte Carlo simulations.br /&nbsp;p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt""span style=""font-family: 宋体; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: 宋体; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin""演讲嘉宾线上进行讲座，预约成功的同学请到经济楼/spanspan lang=""EN-US""font face=""Calibri""N302/font/spanspan style=""font-family: 宋体; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: 宋体; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin""观看，其他师生也可以选择线上参加，参会方式将以邮件形式发送给师生。/spanspan lang=""EN-US""o:p/o:p/span"

We consider an incentivized information-reporting experiment, where the state can be either high, medium, or low, and some information regarding the state is revealed to a decision-maker before he/she sends his/her report of the state information. The payoff is only determined by their reports instead of the true states. We categorize individuals&rsquo; behavior into three types: truth-telling, lying, and guessing. Depending on whether the subject receives full, partial, or no information regarding the state, and whether the required report format is deterministic or probabilistic, our within-subject two-dimensional design consists of in total 6 treatments. The experimental results on deterministic report show that the psychological cost of guessing is higher than truth-telling but less than lying. The discrepancies between deterministic reporting and probabilistic reporting indicate that there exist two conflicting factors influencing the probabilistic report results: On the one hand, participants have more incentive to misreport for a higher payoff; On the other hand, participants may feel more pressure when they input the possibility percentages. Our findings confirm that guessing is an ambiguous but significant type of behavior, distinguishing from lying and truth-telling, and provide a better understanding regarding how information environment and report format lead to honest or dishonest behavior."

We use matched firm-level customs and manufacturing survey data, together with Input-Output tables for China, to examine how Chinese firms position themselves in global production lines and how this evolves with productivity and performance over the firm lifecycle. We document a sharp rise in the upstreamness of imports, stable positioning of exports, and rapid expansion in production stages conducted in China over the 1992-2014 period, both in the aggregate and within firms over time. Firms span more stages as they grow more productive, bigger and more experienced. This is accompanied by a rise in input purchases, value added in production, and fixed cost levels and shares. It is also associated with higher profits though not with changing profit margins. We rationalize these patterns with a stylized model of the firm lifecycle with complementarity between the scale of production and the scope of stages performed."

Drawing on a unique dataset of scientific subfields linked to Ig Nobel winners between 1992 &ndash; 2009, we implement a Difference-in-Differences design to estimate the causal impact of the prize on scientists&rsquo; publications in subfields. We find the Ig Nobel Prize gives a significant boost to both quantity and quality of publications in the focal subfield without increasing research funding, indicating scientists are responding to the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; factor. We show the prize has a stronger effect on boosting new entries to focal subfields and on subfields linked to less visible publications, suggesting the additional &ldquo;fun&rdquo; factor is due to both the Ig Nobel Prize&rsquo;s publicity and perceived novelty of the winning research.

However, in diverging dimension scenarios, the ICM test may break down and has completely different limiting properties from those in fixed dimension cases, and the related wild bootstrap approximation would also be invalid. To extend the ICM test to diverging dimension settings, we propose a projected adaptiveto-model version of the ICM test. We study the asymptotic properties of the new test under both 15 the null and alternative hypotheses to examine its ability of significance level maintenance and its sensitivity to the global and local alternatives that are distinct from the null at the rate n &minus;1/2 . The corresponding wild bootstrap approximation can still work in diverging dimension scenarios. We also derive the consistency and asymptotically linear representation of the least squares estimator of the parameter at the fastest rate of divergence in the literature for nonlinear models. 20 The numerical studies show that the new test can greatly enhance the performance of the ICM test in high-dimensional cases. We also apply the test to a real data set for illustration."

We propose a generalized fixed effects (GFE) estimation procedure to estimate the model under suitable identification restrictions. To establish the asymptotic properties of the GFE estimators, we invert a number of large dimensional square matrices by approximating them with quasi-Kronecker structured matrices. We establish the asymptotic normality of our GFE estimators and show that their convergence rates depend on the unknown degree of parameter heterogeneity. To make a uniform inference on the common slope component, we propose a novel triple-bootstrap procedure and a hybrid procedure to estimate the asymptotic variance."

Existing literature approaches similar scenarios as aggregation games, but fails to capture the pairwise matching nature in this problem. Many typical properties become invalid, such as the equilibrium uniqueness and usual comparative statics results. I establish this class of games as population games and present three independent sets of conditions that deliver the equilibrium uniqueness. I show that an overall increase in the action cost leads to an overall decrease in the action levels only when the cost distribution is more dispersed.

This irrational pricing bias is larger when bonds have longer maturity, lower credit rating, and weaker government implicit guarantees. We exclude alternative explanations based on the financial underperformance of governments and firms in affected zones.

The proposed method starts with a prespecified layer and progressively moves on to the final output layer. For each target layer, PPCA conducts kernel principal component analysis for the estimated kernel weights. This leads to a significant reduction in the number of kernels in the current layer. As a consequence, the channels used for the next layer are also reduced substantially. This is because the number of kernels used in the current layer determines the number of channels for the next layer. For convenience, we refer to this as a progressive effect. As a consequence, the entire model structure can be substantially compressed, and both the number of parameters and the inference costs can be substantially reduced. Meanwhile, the prediction accuracy remains very competitive with respect to that of the baseline model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on a number of classical CNNs (AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet and MobileNet) and benchmark datasets. The empirical findings are very encouraging."

Using three waves of a comprehensive national survey data from 2011 to 2015 of China, we find that as the housing value goes up, non-only children take more care of their parents including contacting more frequently and increasing economic support. We observe more pronounced effects for elder parents. By contrast, only-children's care for their parents is not affected by the housing value. Further, the changes in &lsquo;invisible&rsquo; financial assets such as deposit, stock, and fund have no effect on children&rsquo;s caregiving behavior. Children&rsquo;s care indeed has a positive effect on parent&rsquo;s health and happiness. Overall, findings in this paper offer a novel insight into the role of housing and bequest in parents caring.注：演讲嘉宾线上进行讲座，预约成功的同学请到经济楼N302观看，其他师生也可以选择线上参加，参会方式将以邮件形式发送给师生。"

(2019) by not having the Fund absorbing all the sovereign debt of a country. The Fund's long-term contracts are subject to two-sided limited enforcement constraints: at any point in time the borrowing country may breach the contract and exit, while the Fund cannot have expected losses. The country's constraint therefore represents a sovereignty constraint, whereas the lenders' constraint can be interpreted as a debt sustainability analysis (DSA). The country can borrow long-term defaultable bonds on the private international market, while having a state-contingent contract with the Fund, which provides insurance and, possibly, credit. The Fund contract has no seniority with respect to the privately held sovereign debt and, therefore, takes this external debt into account. The share of debt held by the Fund might be indeterminate; nevertheless, there is one contract that minimizes the debt absorbed by the Fund. In equilibrium, the Fund contract prevents the country from defaulting on its entire debt position. As a result, the debt in the private international market becomes risk-free, although it is constrained when the Fund's limited enforcement constraint binds. The latter therefore internalizes a pecuniary externality that competitive private lenders usually do not: the fact that marginal lending can result in debt becoming unsustainable. In light of this, our model provides an appealing theoretical and quantitative framework to address sovereign debt-overhang problems and, in doing so, increasing the supply of &lsquo;safe assets&rsquo;, in the Euro Area and elsewhere."

Standard social-preference models assume that what drives these decisions is simply a relative weight on one&rsquo;s own payoffs compared to those of the other(s). Recent work has argued that other factors such as predispositions or lagged consideration of certain attributes might also affect decision-making. Here, we investigate how predispositions and the temporal dynamics of the choice process influence social decisions, and how these factors explain individual differences in the effects of time pressure and delay. We use a series of mini-dictator games in which participants make binary decisions about how to allocate money between themselves and another participant with and without time constraints. Using (computer) mouse tracking and a time-varying drift diffusion model (tDDM), we find that selfish participants are delayed in processing others&rsquo; payoffs, while the opposite is true for pro-social participants. The relative onset times of the payoffs, whose tDDM and mouse-tracking estimates are highly correlated, are associated with participants&rsquo; pro-sociality in the time-free condition. Replicating Chen and Krajbich (2018), we find that time pressure amplifies participants&rsquo; general preferences, making them more pro-social or selfish, while time delay attenuated their general preferences, making them less extreme. Participants&rsquo; predispositions are the strongest predictors of behavioral change under time constraints, while relative onset times also contribute when the payoff weights are sufficiently large. These findings improve our understanding of pro-social behavior."

This paper investigates the role of realized volatility in pricing VIX option, which is a popular tool that enables investors to trade volatility directly. We consider both the Generalized Affine Realized Volatility model (GARV) and the Realized GARCH model, to model the joint dynamics of underlying S&amp;P 500 index and realized volatility. A closed-form VIX option price for the GARV model is developed via Fourier inverse transformation. The Realized GARCH is a log-linear and non-affine model, therefore we introduce a novel approximation method to derive its analytical pricing formula. The newly proposed method is fast with a high degree of accuracy. Our empirical results show that models with realized volatility significantly outperform conventional GARCH-type models based on daily returns only. Among these, the Realized GARCH model provides the best pricing performance due to its less constraints and a more flexible modeling structure. Our results hold both in-sample and out-of-sample."

However, batch-based DRL algorithms cannot guarantee the non-decreasing property of learned quantile curves especially at the early training stage, leading to abnormal distribution estimates and reduced model interpretability. To address these issues, we introduce a general DRL framework by using non-crossing quantile regression to ensure the monotonicity constraint within each sampled batch, which can be incorporated with some well-known DRL algorithm. We demonstrate the validity of our method from both the theory and model implementation perspectives. Experiments on Atari 2600 Games show that some state-of-art DRL algorithms with the non-crossing modification can significantly outperform their baselines in terms of faster convergence speeds and better testing performance. In particular, our method can effectively recover the distribution information and thus dramatically increase the exploration efficiency when the reward space is extremely sparse.演讲嘉宾线上进行讲座，预约成功的同学请到经济楼N302观看，其他师生也可以选择线上参加，参会方式将以邮件形式发送给师生。"

Our finding is robust for different sample periods, macroeconomic news announcements, and market inefficiency measures. Investor heterogeneity could explain the decreased market efficiency before scheduled news announcements."

Moreover, the employment favoritism in issuance biases bond credit allocation towards underperforming firms with a large em-ployment size.

The dual gravity model has a well-established economic foundation and it has the form of a spatial autoregressive model (SAR). The dual gravity model is originated by Behrens et al. (2012), but the spatial weights matrix motivated by their economic theory has a feature which violates existing regularity conditions for asymptotic econometrics analysis. By overcoming the limitation of existing asymptotic theory, we show that QML estimates are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Simulation results show the satisfactory finite sample performance of the estimates. We illustrate the usefulness of the model by investigating the McCallum &quot;border puzzle&quot; in the gravity literature."

There is concern that malnutrition may detrimentally affect children&rsquo;s development, including their cognitive ability and social emotion. Medical studies have not yet identified the exact nature of the impact malnutrition has on children. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between malnutrition and developmental outcomes among preschoolers in poor, rural, ethnic areas of China. We conducted a survey in Hunan province in southcentral China in 2018. Of the 1293 sample preschoolers, the prevalence of anemia, stunting, and underweight was 33.4%, 10.6%, and 5.4%, respectively. After controlling for socioeconomic status, we observed that malnourished preschoolers performed worse in cognitive tests and social emotions than their well-nourished peers. While not causal, this study also presents evidence that left-behind preschoolers performed as well as preschoolers living with both parents. However, both groups performed poorly on most of these indicators. Given these important linkages, we hope that our results will contribute positively to the drive towards ending malnutrition.&nbsp;线上讲座，如参加可请登录腾讯会议平台：https://meeting.tencent.com/s/jEc6RCcSiqI8会议 ID：819 934 163N302届时播放讲座，也可到现场观看。&nbsp;"

Using an equilibrium sorting model and rich micro data from China, we evaluate the impacts of these dual constraints on workers sorting behavior and quantify the resulting changes in aggregate welfare and inequality. We find strong policy interactions between the two kinds of frictions in determining welfare losses and regional inequality. Counterfactual simulations show that lowering migration costs can increase welfare and reduce regional inequality by moving workers from unproductive inland regions to productive coastal regions in China; such welfare and regional distributional impacts depend on the elasticity of housing supply in coastal regions and vice-versa. Results highlight the policy complementarities between reducing the two kinds of frictions and have general implications for countries with different levels of constraints on mobility and housing supply."

From a statistical perspective, deep learning can be viewed as a regression method with complicated input X and output Y. One unique character about deep learning is that the input X could be highly unstructured data (e.g., images and sentences) and the output(outputs?) Y are usual responses (e.g., class label). Another unique character about deep learning is that it has a highly nonlinear model structure with many layers. This provides us a basic theoretical foundation to understand deep learning from statistical perspectives. We do believe classical statistical wisdom combined with modern deep learning techniques can bring us novel methodology with outstanding empirical performance. In this talk, I would like to report 3 recent progresses made by our team in this regard.  The first progress is about stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. SGD is the most popularly optimization algorithm used for deep learning model training. Its practical implementation relies on the specification of a tuning parameter: learning rate. In current practical applications, the choice of learning rate is highly subjective and depends on personal experiences. To solve the problem, we propose a local quadratic approximation (LQA) idea for an automatic and nearly optimal determination of the tuning parameter. The second progress focuses on model compression for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Convolution neural network is one of the representative models in deep learning which has shown excellent performance in the field of computer vision. However, it is extremely complicated with a huge number of parameters. We then try to apply the classical principal component analysis (PCA) method to each convolutional layer, which leads to a new method called progressive principal component analysis (PPCA) method. Our PPCA method brings a significant reduction in model complexity without significantly sacrifices the out-of-sample forecasting accuracy. The last progress considers factor modeling. The input feature of a deep learning model is often of ultrahigh dimension (e.g., an image). In this case, a strong factor structure of the input feature can be detected constantly. This means a significant proportion of variability about the input feature can be explained by a low dimensional latent factor, which could be modeled in a very easy way. We then develop a novel factor normalization (FN) methodology. We first decompose an input feature X into two parts: the factor part and the residual part. Next, we reconstruct the baseline DNN model into a factor-assisted DNN model. Lastly, we provide a new SGD algorithm with adaptive learning rates for new model training. Our method leads to superior convergence speed and excellent out-of-sample performances compared to original model with a series of gradient type algorithms.本场讲座采取预约制，名额有限，有意线上参加者请点击下方链接报名，报名后如无法参加请自行取消报名。报名链接：a href=""https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_M9C8piKgRD6b95mhQINp7g""点击报名/a&nbsp;注册成功后zoom会通过email发送听会连接，请注意把no-reply@zoom.us放入白名单，或重新查看注册页面以获取听会连接&nbsp;"

By equally weighting the sample moments, the test is asymptotically correct in high dimensions even when the number of coefficients is larger than the sample size. Our theory allows a non-parametric error distribution and the estimation of the autoregressive coefficients. Using random matrix theory, we show that the test has the optimal asymptotic testing power among a large class of competitors against local dense alternatives whose direction is free in the eigenbasis of the sample covariance matrix among regressors. The asymptotic results are adaptive to the predictors&rsquo; cross-sectional and temporal dependence structure and do not require a limiting spectral law of their sample covariance matrix. The method extends to general nuisance variables beyond autoregressors, and we give a robust modification for irregular scenarios. Monte Carlo studies suggest a good power performance of our proposed test against high dimensional dense alternative for various data generating processes. We apply the test to detect the significance of over one hundred exogenous variables in the FRED-MD database for predicting the monthly growth in the US industrial production index."

Two major challenges complicate the statistical analysis of such data. First, only a small proportion of units have complete information across all sources. Second, the missing data patterns vary across individuals. Our motivating online-loan data have 93% missing covariates where the missing pattern is individual-specific. The existing regression analysis with missing covariates either are inefficient or require additional modeling assumptions on the covariates. We propose a simple yet efficient iterative least squares estimator of the regression coefficient for the data with individual-specific missing patterns. Our method has several desirable features. First, it does not require any modeling assumptions on the covariates. Second, the imputation of the missing covariates involves feasible one-dimensional nonparametric regressions, and can maximally use the information across units and the relationship among the covariates. Third, the iterative least squares estimate is both computationally and statistically efficient. We study the asymptotic properties of our estimator and apply it to the motivating online-loan data."

The new procedure overcomes the challenge of tuning parameter selection of Lasso and possesses several appealing properties. It uses an easily simulated tuning parameter that automatically adapts to both the unknown random error distribution and the correlation structure of the design matrix. It is robust with substantial efficiency gain for heavy-tailed random errors while maintaining high efficiency for normal random errors. Comparing with other alternative robust regression procedures, it also enjoys the property of being equivariant when the response variable undergoes a scale transformation. Computationally, it can be efficiently solved via linear programming. Theoretically, under weak conditions on the random error distribution, we establish a finite-sample error bound with a near-oracle rate for the new estimator with the simulated tuning parameter. Our results make useful contributions to mending the gap between the practice and theory of Lasso and its variants. We also prove that further improvement in efficiency can be achieved by a second-stage enhancement with some light tuning. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods often outperform cross-validated Lasso in various settings."

For change point detection, given any subgroup of variables, we propose a new method for testing the homogeneity of corresponding regression coefficients across the observations. The test statistic is based on a weighted /spanspan class=""fontstyle2""L/spanspan class=""fontstyle3""1&nbsp;/spanspan class=""fontstyle0""aggregation, both temporally and spatially, of a de-biased lasso process. A multiplier bootstrap procedure is introduced to approximate its limiting distribution. For change point identification, at each fixed time point, we first aggregate spatial information of the debiased lasso process with /spanspan class=""fontstyle2""L/spanspan class=""fontstyle3""1/spanspan class=""fontstyle0""-norm, then a change point estimator is obtained by taking &ldquo;argmax&rdquo; with respect to time of the above aggregated process. Under /spanspan class=""fontstyle4""H/spanspan class=""fontstyle5""1/spanspan class=""fontstyle0"", the change point estimator is shown to be consistent for the true change point location. Moreover, to further improve the estimation accuracy of change point estimators and reduce the computational burden of the testing procedure, a two-step refitting algorithm and a screeningbased method are proposed. Extensive simulation studies justify the validity of our newbr /method and a real data application further demonstrates its competitive performance.

Using a massive dataset of nearly 1.5 million interactions between 2003 and 2012 since the inception of Couchsurfing.org, a popular online hospitality exchange service that disallows monetary exchanges, we show evidence that such evaluations in fact may be systematically distorted by many complex social-psychological processes. We find a major structural imbalance of mutual evaluations between interacting partners who possess different demographic and role-related characteristics. These distortions may lead to a number of undesirable outcomes, as they may signal inconsistent information about users and products, which creates biases and may affect decision making, inducing users to strategically seek to preserve their reputation at the expense of other more relevant utilities. We derive an evolutionary game theoretical model from empirical outcomes of interactions to reason about these situations. We treat rating imbalance as reputation payoffs and model user strategies in the reputation game as immutable (or evolutionary), capturing the fact that it is unrealistic to change one's demographic features for the sole purpose of playing optimally.p class=""MsoNormal""span lang=""EN-US""Last, we seek evidence that users may try to counteract the inevitable effect of their personal features on ratings by strategically selecting others for interaction in ways that minimize their impact on reputation. We discover via a blockmodel that users often deviate from their optimal strategy.&nbsp; However, we find evidence that this sub-optimal behavior stems from a lack of awareness of the reputation game dynamics. We observe that many users learn and eventually switch to optimal strategies over time, while some abandon optimal strategies once they accrue enough reputation to achieve their goals.o:p/o:p/span"

We find that the act of forming study teams alone can increase students&rsquo; academic (cognitive) performance and personality (non-cognitive skills) in the dimensions of conscientiousness, extroversion, openness, and neuroticism, whereas agreeableness decreases. These changes in personality traits may reflect positive changes in the attitudes of students toward cooperation and competition. Our mechanism test suggests that improvement in non-cognitive skills and better in-class discipline are working mechanism to improve academic performance."

I exploit a regulatory experiment that randomly selected a group of pilot listed firms and removed their short-selling restrictions from 2004 to 2007. Some of these pilot firms are banks involved in residential mortgage origination. Using a difference-in-differences specification, I find that the growth rate of mortgage origination is lower for the treated banks by 25 to 54 percentage points. This pattern is observed for portfolio mortgages but not for securitized mortgages. Counties with higher market shares of the treated banks prior to the treatment experienced less deterioration in housing markets, unemployment rates, and per capita income during the Great Recession. The findings shed light on the role of equity market efficiency in the stability of the real economy."

However, data limitations make it challenging to evaluate competing claims about the state of Chinese housing markets.  This paper brings new data and analysis to the study of supply and demand conditions in nearly three dozen major cities.br /We find that (1) Real house price growth has been high, averaging 10% per annum since 2006.  However, there is substantial heterogeneity across markets, ranging from 2.8% (Jinan) to 19.8% (Beijing).  House price growth is driven by rising land values, not by construction costs.  Real land values have risen by 14.4% per annum on average.  In Beijing, the increase has been by a remarkable 27.5% per year (or by 1,036%) since 2004. (2) There is variation in the strong positive trend in house prices and land value growth.  Land values fell by nearly one-third at the beginning of the global financial crisis, but more than fully recovered amidst the 2009-2010 Chinese stimulus.  More recent growth has been much more modest, with some markets beginning to decline.  Quantities of land sales by local governments to private residential developers have dropped sharply since 2013.  The most recent data show transaction volumes down by half or more.  This should lead to a reduced supply of new housing units in coming years. (3) Market-level analysis of short- and longer-run changes in supply-demand balances finds important variation across markets.  In the major East region markets of Beijing, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, which have experienced very high rates of real price growth, we estimate that the growth in households demanding housing units has outpaced new construction since the turn of the century.  However, there are thirteen large markets, primarily in the interior of the country, in which new housing production has outpaced household growth by at least 30% and another eleven in which it did so by at least 10%.  Regression results show that a one standard deviation increase in local market housing inventory is associated with a 0.45 standard deviation lower rate of real house price growth the following year."

In Rubinstein and Wolinsky&rsquo;s seminal model on intermediation, middlemen only create value when they have an exogenous advantage in their search speed. I show that this result depends critically on the restriction that middlemen can only carry indivisible quantities of goods. Taking into account the intensive margin of production and allowing them to carry divisible quantities, middlemen with comparatively high bargaining power can create value even when they have a disadvantage in their search cost. While the presence of middlemen can improve welfare, equilibria remain suboptimal due to search and participation externalities. I describe a multi-instrument tax-subsidy scheme that controls participation levels by producers and middlemen and restores efficiency.&nbsp;"

We examine what are the determinants of our market leverage measure, and whether this leverage measure is a state variable for asset pricing. We show that the time-series variation of market leverage can be explained by the change of market liquidity, market volatility, funding liquidity, and past stock market performance. We then find that the average return on stocks with high sensitivity to unexpected change of market leverage exceeds that for stocks with low sensitivity by about 5-6% annually, adjusted for exposure to the market return as well as size, value, and momentum factors."

We find that non-agricultural exports substantially raised rural income, with stronger effects on lower income households. Such export-induced income growth is driven by higher labor force participation rate, wage increases in both agricultural sector and non-agricultural sector, and a reallocation of labor between these two sectors. Exports also significantly reduced the incidence of local poverty.  &nbsp;"

To deal with the identifiability problem caused by nonignorable dropout, we use an instrument which is a covariate unrelated to the dropout propensity. We apply the generalized method of moments to estimate the parameters in the dropout propensity model based on some estimating equations constructed using the instrument. Population means and other parameters in the nonparametric distribution of the study variable can be estimated based on inverse propensity weighting with weights constructed after addressing the nonignorable dropout. To improve efficiency, we derive a model-assisted regression estimator making use of extra information provided by the covariates and previously observed study variables in the longitudinal setting. The model-assisted regression estimator is protected from model misspecification, and is shown to be asymptotically normal and more efficient than the estimator based on inverse propensity weighting when the working models are correct or nearly correct and some other conditions are satisfied. The finite-sample performance of the estimators is studied through simulation, and an application to the HIV-CD4 data set is also presented as illustration./span/span"

We find that the speed of supply-chain information diffusion positively (negatively) affects the sensitivity of supplier investment to its own (customer's) price. These results are consistent with learning from prices and suggest that supplier managers vary their reliance on their own versus their customer's  stock prices depending upon their relative price informativeness.

If being risk-neutral, firms will always invest more in the auctioning scheme. These outcomes will remain true if firms are ambiguity-averse or if output and permit markets are duopolistic. These findings suggest that the trading scheme with high permit price floors and/or large differences between ceilings and floors of permit prices can promote firms' environmental R&amp;D investments.&nbsp;"

Unlike Approximate Factor Models (AFM), where only mean-shifting factors can be extracted, QFM also allow to recover unobserved factors shifting other relevant parts of the distributions of observed variables. A quantile regression approach, labeled Quantile Factor Analysis (QFA), is proposed to consistently estimate all the quantile-dependent factors and loadings. Their asymptotic distribution is then derived using a kernel-smoothed version of the QFA estimators. Two consistent model selection criteria, based on information criteria and rank minimization, are developed to determine the number of factors at each quantile. Moreover, in contrast to the conditions required for the use of Principal Components Analysis in AFM, QFA estimation remains valid even when the idiosyncratic errors have heavy-tailed distributions. Three empirical applications (regarding climate, financial and macroeconomic panel data) provide evidence that extra factors shifting quantiles other than the means could be relevant in practice."

In this paper, we consider a multi-asset economy with four types of investors who have heterogeneous beliefs on correlation coefficient, and the ambiguity-averse traders make their decisions in a Maxmin Expected Utility framework. A unique general equilibrium presents in four scenarios according to size of dispersion measure. We define a measure to gauge the degree of portfolio under-diversification, with which we show that correlation ambiguity will drive less-inside investors to hold an undiversified portfolio if correlation coefficient is negative, while when a positive correlation prevails in the economy, the less-informed the investors, the more likely that they hold a fully diversified portfolio. We finally do a CAPM analysis in this paper, the results indicate that high-quality risky assets are generally over-priced and vice versa."

Our findings indicate that relative to firms that share similar corporate characteristics but are located in regions that do not experience terrorist attacks, public firms located in close proximity to terrorist attacks (i.e., the impact firms) substantially increase their investment in CSR following terrorist events. We further observe a strengthened association between CSR and firm value for the impact firms in the periods following terrorist events, especially when the CSR efforts of the impact firms are associated with greater media attention. Our additional results reveal that the impact firms tend to commit more resources to enhancing the environment, community, and diversity related dimensions of CSR following terrorist events. Overall, our findings support the conjecture that although firms located in the areas most impacted by terrorist attacks are likely to experience a greater demand for CSR activities, the value of the impact firms&rsquo; CSR investments increase because their CSR efforts are likely to gain greater community visibility, especially in the periods following terrorist events."

We find that CDB credit to strategic industries at the top of the supply chain leads to lower prices, higher amounts, and more product varieties of export goods for firms in downstream industries. This increased import competition crowds out U.S. firms in the same industry but crowds in firms in downstream. In the recent trade war, the U.S. raised tariffs strategically on China&rsquo;s imports that compete with domestic U.S. manufacturers rather than used as their inputs."

China&rsquo;s rural reforms during the early 1980s secured land tenure for peasants and dismantled large collective farms into small household farms, which transformed tillage technology. Using a novel data set of 1,755 counties from 1976 to 1988, our event study exploits the county-by-county rollout of the reform. We find that the use of tractors plummeted after the reform while the use of draft animals surged. Post-reform tractor use, however, became more efficient: it was more suitable to local factor endowments and related to higher grain yields."

We generalize this mechanism by allowing the shocks to be non-Gaussian (but light-tailed) and dependent upon a Markov state variable. Our main results provide sharp bounds on tail probabilities, simple formulas for Pareto exponents, and comparative statics. We present two applications: we show that (i) the tails of the wealth distribution in a heterogeneous-agent dynamic general equilibrium model with idiosyncratic investment risk is Paretian, and (ii) a random growth model for the population dynamics of Japanese municipalities is consistent with the observed Pareto exponent but only after allowing for Markovian dynamics.&nbsp;"

These wedges serve as mechanisms to eliminate&nbsp;information-induced&nbsp;distortions to learning, so&nbsp;agents are deterred from under-investing in human capital,&nbsp;over-saving, and&nbsp;shirking during their life cycle. We also construct a tax system, in which these wedges are represented by&nbsp;linear capital and labor income taxes that can implement constrained efficient allocations&nbsp;as an equilibrium in a market economy."

Depending on the hedging outcomes, fuel costs can vary (sometimes significantly) across airlines at a given time. Hedging gain/loss comes in the form a lump sum amount, and does not affect airlines&rsquo; marginal cost. Consequently hedging gain/loss should not affect airlines&rsquo; ticket pricing decisions. Yet we find that hedging gain/loss, which affects the accounting cost but not true economic cost of fuel, impacts ticket prices significantly (both statistically and economically). Our results suggest that airlines,  when making ticket pricing decision , use accounting cost instead of economic cost (the true opportunity cost) of fuel. This can also be interpreted as sunk cost fallacy since the hedging gain/loss is sunk at the time of ticket pricing decisions. We then look for and test alternative explanations."

By employing daily returns, we find that the Fama-French models explain equity returns quite well in our sample. More importantly, this over-performance seems to appear when the market is in a crash than in a soaring or fluctuating market. This finding is confirmed by the results of time-series regressions, GRS F-tests, Fama-MacBeth regressions, and other metrics. However, Hansen&rsquo;s (1992) instability tests suggest that the Fama-French model is hardly constant over time and tends to present a higher level of instability in the crash than in the recovery of the market.

The investor benefits from liquidity diversification, which results from the alternative assets&rsquo; staggered maturity dates. The quantitative results of our calibrated model match the spending and asset allocation decisions of university endowment funds, if the alternative asset earns an expected risk-adjusted net-of-fees return of 2-3% (with public equity as the benchmark)."

Using data from two banks, one state-owned and the other partially privatized, we show a clear increase in lending in the final days of each month, resulting from both more loan issuance and higher value per loan. We estimate that daily lending is 92 percent higher in the last 5 days of each month as a result of loan targets, with only a small amount plausibly attributable to shifting loans forward from the following month. End-of-month loans are 1.6 percentage points (12 percent) more likely to be classified as bad in the years following issuance relative to mid-month loans. Our work highlights the distortionary effects of target-setting on capital allocation, in a context in which such concerns have risen to particular prominence in recent years."

We then simulate the effect of allowing an EU LCC to serve U.S. markets and we find that U.S. travelers&rsquo; initial welfare gains would be modest because airline competition is already intense.  However, travelers&rsquo; benefits are likely to grow significantly over time as all carriers develop their networks to offer seamless domestic and international travel."

A single type of error structure may not represent all the individuals in the population and the preference or taste for each attribute of an alternative could vary across individuals. To capture heterogeneous choice behavior we provide an identification strategy for multinomial discrete choice models utilizing error symmetry. Our identification method allows for interpersonal heteroskedasticity on a subset of covariates. In the presence of random coefficients, our semiparametric method does not require numerical integration or the knowledge of the number of random coefficients, which are the two main challenges of implementing a random coefficient parametric method. Flexible correlation and heteroskedasticity among alternatives are also permitted. Based on the identification strategy, we propose an M-estimator by minimizing the squared difference of the volumes of two symmetric hyper-rectangles under the joint probability measure of the error terms. We show that the M-estimator is root-N-consistent and admits a normal limiting distribution. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate finite-sample performance of the estimator under various data generating processes. We compare the estimates of the proposed method with those of a flexible conditional probit model and find prominent gaps between those estimates in the presence of interpersonal heteroskedasticity and heterogeneous preferences."

When financial markets are incomplete, international risk sharing is disturbed. However, the optimal global policy significantly reverses the welfare deterioration due to inefficient risk-sharing. We find that when financial markets are more incomplete, the welfare gap between the optimal global policy and the Nash equilibrium increases, and the welfare gains from policy cooperation in capital controls then become larger."

Agents trade the cryptocurrency using digital wallets and the cryptocurrency system provides a way to verify the history of double spending attempts of digital wallets. Delaying delivery of goods until payment information is confirmed in the blockchain prevents double spending. However, double spending can be prevented without delivery lags if a wallet has a good reputation about the history of double spending attempts under some conditions. In particular, as the difficulty of mining work rises, double spending incentives with a good wallet decreases. We study the optimal design of cryptocurrency in terms of the difficulty of mining work and the supply of cryptocurrency, and evaluate the welfare gain in the current Bitcoin system from adopting the optimal cryptocurrency system."

This paper develops a small open economy New Keynesian model incorporating an oil-sector and financial frictions to quantitatively evaluate the role of monetary and fiscal policy interaction in the transmission of oil-price shocks. We estimate our model using data of Russia and find that monetary and fiscal policy regime switch is crucial to account for the observed asymmetric response of exchange rates to oil-price shocks. Our result shows that the exchange rate does not move much with oil prices when fiscal space is ample, but fiscal stress caused by low oil prices significantly amplifies the negative oil-price shock and produces a drastic currency depreciation. Therefore, our analysis suggests the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy as an important propagation mechanism. Moreover, fiscal space is valuable since it allows monetary policy to actively stabilize the exchange rate, which is desirable in the presence of financial frictions.&nbsp;"

He got a Ph.D. from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2008 and worked as a Research Associate there before joined Renmin University of China in 2010. His main research interests are in macroeconomics with the focus on fiscal policy, economic growth, monetary economics, and Chinese economy. His research has been published in the refereed journals as Journal of International Economics, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, Economic Theory, Journal of Mathematical Economics, Macroeconomic Dynamics, Journal of Public Economic Theory, Journal of Macroeconomics, and Economics Letters, etc.",Fiscal Policy and Aggregate Stability,"N302, Econ Building","                                                                In reference to the recent economic downturns in the Western developed economies, the importance of balanced-budget rule in fiscal discipline is recalled the profession. But there is a concern among macroeconomists about the destabilizing nature of this fiscal rule. In this project, we aim to examine the interaction of specific market structures and tax policies that may constitute a potential destabilizing force unrelated to economic fundamentals. We investigate the mechanism through which indeterminacy, and hence endogenous economic fluctuations will or will not occur with different fiscal policies."

Our key innovation is to use changes in ministers of Chinese State Council as a source of exogenous variation in city-level intergovernmental transfers and hence fiscal expenditures. We find: (1) the local fiscal multiplier is estimated around 3.88 and there are no significant spillover effects; (2) local effective tax rates do not respond to such fiscal expansions; (3) private firms, instead of state owned enterprises (SOEs), are benefited more from such fiscal shocks; (4) the increase of output comes from firms&rsquo; employment expansions rather than capital investments. Our results contrast the conventional view that Chinese fiscal expansion works through SOEs, suggesting new considerations in evaluating the impact of government expenditure."

Evidence from the Age Regulations on Chinese Soccer,"N302, Econ Building","                                                                &nbsp;&nbsp;As a piece of the Olympic Strategy, the age regulations in the professional soccer in China give the targeted groups, such as the aged 23 in Olympic years, certain advantages in their career development. We use the changes of age limit policies as natural experiments to study the distortion effects of the age regulations on the human capital distribution across age cohorts. To study the effects, we construct a data combing players' performance in professional leagues and national teams, as well as the results of the bone age assessments of young players. Using the data, we find that the targeted groups of the regulations gain higher human capital levels than the others in terms of market values and the performance in professional game. The paper shows that the following responses to the regulations attribute to the distortion effects. First, professional clubs give more opportunities to the young players of the targeted group because of political pressure. Second, the soccer association arranges more games for the targeted group. Third, some players of the untargeted group modified their ages to meet the age requirements of the policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

We first consider a parametric nonresponse model and discuss a new identifiability condition without relying on an instrumental variable assumption. After that, a very general result for semiparametric optimal estimation under nonignorable nonresponse is presented and then two adaptive estimators for semiparametric optimal estimation are proposed. Because the proposed estimators achieve the semiparametric optimality, their statistical performances are better than&nbsp; the existing methods, which was demonstrated in the simulation study and in the real data analysis. &nbsp;Furthermore, some extensions to semiparametric nonresponse models are also discussed.

We ?nd that the goal amounts of reward-based crowdfunding campaigns on Kickstarter exhibit clear clustering at round num-bers. More importantly, the use of round goal amounts is associated with a signi?cantly lower likelihood of campaign success and generally adverse campaign performance for the entrepreneurs. Our results also show that the use of round numbers in prior cam-paigns has predictive power over subsequent campaign success, suggesting that the round number heuristic conveys information about entrepreneur quality. Finally, we ?nd that the likelihood of setting a round goal amount decreases with entrepreneurial experience in crowdfunding, indicating an improved entrepreneur quality via learning by doing."

Our approach allowing arbitrary grouping provides the foundation to design a data-driven inference procedure which finds the best grouping specification among all possible groupings, and allowing discrete variables is mainly motivated by concerns from applied research. We effectively transform the generalized additive model with unknown link function into a problem which is much easier to estimate by sieve approach. Our estimator for link function is shown to converge at a rate of one covariate, and estimators for component functions within the link can attain nonparametric rates of their own covariates. By simulation, we show that such a method has good performance in finite samples."

We find that firms in more corrupt regions report more conservatively. Namely, they are more likely to speed recognition of bad news and slow recognition of good news in reported earnings relative to firms in less corrupt regions. Similar results are obtained when we use the recent anti-corruption campaign in China as a quasi-natural experiment. Further analysis reveals that the positive effect of local corruption on reporting conservatism is stronger when firms are more likely to be expropriated by corrupt officials. Collectively, these findings suggest that through adopting more conservative financial reporting policies, firms manage earnings and net worth downward to shield their business from expropriation by corrupt local officials."

We propose three hypotheses to explain this phenomenon and find that news momentum is driven by the persistence of firms&rsquo; fundamentals instead of stale news or firms&rsquo; strategic disclosure. A trading strategy, which combines a long position in a good-news quintile portfolio with a short position in a bad-news portfolio, generates 7.45 percent risk-adjusted return annually. This return anomaly appears on both news and non-news days. Overall, these findings suggest that the cross-sectional prediction of news is not fully incorporated into the stock price by investors."

In this paper, we describe one such mechanism, which was used for the assignment of civil servants from the late 16th century to early 20th century in China. Based on original documents and historical studies, we provide the first formal description of this procedure: candidates were assigned to jobs through a sequential lottery-based procedure, while at the same time preventing workers to be matched to jobs that were incompatible with them. We show that the procedure was inefficient, and document a change made in the 18th century that mitigates these inefficiencies. Based on what we determine to be the characteristics that were necessary for its success, generalize the procedure used in China to a wider family of assignment problems where workers may have different sets of compatible jobs, and describe how to arrange the sets of urns and workers, so that the resulting random assignment mechanism"

Although subjects fail to consume optimally across all systems, we find that a voluntary but binding savings product induces subjects to save more. In contrast, we find that obligatory contributions do not induce people to save more overall. Moreover, subjects perform worse when income is stochastic rather than constant, casting doubt on the empirical relevance of the precautionary savings motive. In line with this finding, risk aversion does not seem to have a significant e˙ect on savings, while better cognitive abilities lead to better savings decisions."

However, our empirical study on a financial data has shown that both of these models have drawbacks when applied to locally stationary time series. For the analysis of functional data, Zhang and Wang have proposed a flexible regression method, called the varying-coefficient additive model (VCAM), and presented a two-step spline estimation method. Motivated by their approach, we adopt the VCAM to characterize the time-varying regression function in a locally stationary context. We propose a three-step spline estimation method and show its consistency and asymptotic normality. For the purpose of model diagnosis, we suggest an L2-distance test statistic to check multiplicative assumption, and raise a two-stage penalty procedure to identify the additive terms and the varying-coefficient terms provided that the VCAM is applicable. We also present the asymptotic distribution of the proposed test statistics, and demonstrate the consistency of the two-stage model identification procedure. Simulation studies investigating the finite sample performance of the estimation and model diagnosis methods confirm the validity of our asymptotic theory. A financial data is also considered./span"

We implement a laboratory experiment for 3 person cooperative games. In our experiment, the subjects negotiate with each other about both of a payoff distribution and a coalition formation.br /They can offer not only the grand coalition but 2 person coalitions. Each experimental session consists of 10 super-additive games which are the same as Nash et al. (2012), but the experimental protocol is very different.br /One half of the games are balanced, which means they have a non-empty core and the other half do not have the core. Our main findings are as follows. First, the subjects are more likely to form the grand coalition in the balanced games than in the non-balanced games. Second, in the balanced games, larger and larger the core is, more and more frequently they form the grand coalition. Third, the resulting payoff distribution is correlated to his or her quota that represents power in negotiation based on worth of the two person coalitions. These results are opposite to those of Nash et al. (2012). We also show that the chat window and the order of the games matter a lot."

Having precise information of the transaction price and the reported price to the tax authority, we show that after the capital gains tax increase, property sellers&rsquo; reported price to the tax authority is 15% lower. We also document that the policy has strong heterogeneous effects, whereby wealthy cash buyers are 5.6% more likely to buy a house than buyers who need financing. This is mainly because financing buyers prefer a higher reported price to secure higher bank financing but sellers prefer a lower reported price to evade taxes. This exacerbates wealth inequality in a rising housing market."

It does not explain how or why the inefficiency might evolve as the economy develops. We generalize the literature by allowing for multiple forms of cross border capital flows and embedding a role for institutions. In our model, poor domestic institutional quality leads to an inefficient external capital structure and thus excessive volatile capital flows. Therefore, optimal capital controls policy should depend on the quality of domestic institutions. We show that the policy includes a Pigovian tax on both external debt and equity and it decreases with domestic quality. We provide empirical evidence that is consistent with the theoretical model."

Using a game-theoretic approach within a monocentric city framework, this article addresses the questions by analyzing developers&rsquo; optimal entry decisions in a duopoly market setting. When property rents and development costs vary across locations and evolve stochastically over time, the frequently observed frog-leap phenomenon can occur if a suburban developer has the locational advantage in rent and/or cost than an urban developer. The Goldilocks principle also applies to each developer&rsquo;s preemption strategy when competition is sufficiently intense such that both developers have incentives to be the leader. That is, when the volatility of the operating environment in the real estate market is not too high or too low, a developer will enter the market at the date that prevents her/his rival from entry rather than maximizes her/his value as the leader such that overbuilding will arise.&nbsp;/spanp class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:&#10;inter-ideograph;line-height:22.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:&#10;none""span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-font-kerning:&#10;0pt""o:p/o:p/span"

While extensive works show that long-term geographic proximity affects work behavior, little is known about the effect of short-term colocation like conferences. Using participant data at Gordon Research Conferences, we estimate difference-in-differences and instrumental variable models that show that attendees who have no prior within conference collaborations are more likely to collaborate with other attendees, and that the researchers who have worked previously with other attendees are more likely to continue their collaborations. We also find that researchers who are junior, located closer to the conference venue, with established prior ties, and with profiles similar to the conference draw more collaborative benefits from temporary colocation. Thus, going to a conference alters the creation of collaborations."

In this paper we propose a more practical constant proportion port-folio insurance (CPPI) strategy based on the well-known three-fund separation theorem.The proposed three-fund separation CPPI (hereafter 3F-CPPI) strategy optimally allocates its assets in three funds: a risk-free fund, a stock-index fund and a purpose-related stock fund, to maximize the loss averse investor's utility and to control the downside risk as well. Closed-form solutions of the optimal allocations of 3F-CPPI and its outcome distribution have been derived first under the continuous time case, followed by an extensive Monte Carlo simulation under the discrete time case to compare 3F-CPPI with other benchmark strategies such as CPPI. Our simulation results show that the proposed 3F-CPPI dominates other benchmark strategies in almost all the aspects such as the mean return, downside risk control and loss averse utility."

What really matters is that how to interpret it. After criticizing Smith and Ricardo who had tried in vain to discover the secret, Marx put forward his own theory of falling rate of profit. I think this theory is very important, considering that it&rsquo;s based on capital accumulation theory on one hand, and provides the materialism origin for economic crises and collapse of capitalism system on the other hand. This theory has evoked the controversy among both Marxism and other branches for more than one hundred years, especially after the paper by Okishio published in 1961. After reviewing the debate over Okishio theorem, this lecture seeks to build up a new framework of general rate of profit under disequilibrium. And then we can reevaluate the theory of falling rate of profit and realize the modern value of political economy./span"

This model includes many important and popular models in statistics and econometrics as special cases. Although it has been studied for many years, the methods in the literature either are based on kernel-smoothing techniques or make use of only the ranks of the responses in the estimation of the parametric components. The former approach needs a tuning parameter, which is not easily optimally specified in practice; and the latter approach may be less accurate and computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a pairwise rank likelihood method and extend it to a score-function-based method. Our methods estimate all the unknown parameters in the linear transformation model, and we explore the theoretical properties of our proposed estimators. Via extensive numerical studies, we demonstrate that our methods are appealing in that the estimators are not only robust to the distribution of the random errors but also in many cases more accurate than those of the existing methods.br /br /Joint work with Pengfei Li, Baojiang Chen, Ao Yuan and Jing Qin"

Optimal prices are a result of a Markov perfect equilibrium played between the firm and the consumers. Nested in the market equilibrium is a demand equilibrium played among consumers who make the &ldquo;right&rdquo; purchase/wait decisions given endogenously produced product information. The empirical exercises are conducted in two steps. The first step estimates demand parameters, including those associated with social learning. Endogeneity of prices is remedied with a pseudo pricing policy function of relevant state variables. In the second step, optimal prices are found by the Mathematical Programming with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC) approach. The model is applied to the US video games industry with sales data of PlayStation 3 games. The results reveal that (1) compared to static social learning, forward-looking social learning reduces equilibrium profits of games in the sample by $5.2M (28.4%) on average; (2) an incorrect belief of consumers&rsquo; forward-looking behavior reduces a firm&rsquo;s profits by a maximum of 29.92%. These results indicate great value for researches on consumers&rsquo; forward-looking social learning behavior.br /&nbsp;"

I develop a dynamic, stochastic model in which firms possess real options to delay investment, waiting for uncertainty to resolve. My model predicts that a higher degree of financial frictions decreases ISCF by reducing firms&rsquo; borrowing capacity. Meanwhile, more financial frictions also reduce the real-options value by increasing the discount rate, encouraging firms to invest sooner rather than later; as a result, ISCF increases. Furthermore, I introduce uncertainty as an additional determinant of ISCF. Heightened uncertainty decreases ISCF as it enhances the real-options value of waiting. Empirical work studying U.S. listed firms over the past 30 years confirms these predictions."

This is difficult since usually there are a large number of covariates that affect people's treatment decision and the true functional form in the model is not known. Propensity score is a popular approach for dimension reduction in causal inference. We propose a new semiparametric estimation strategy using B-spline based on the propensity score, which does not rely on parametric model specification. We further improve the efficiency of the estimator by addressing the error heteroscedasticity. We also establish the asymptotic properties of both estimators. The simulation studies show that our methods compare favorably with many competing estimators. &nbsp;Our methods are advantageous over weighting estimators as it is not affected by extreme weights. We apply the proposed methods to data from the Ohio Medicaid Assessment Survey (OMAS) 2012, estimating the effect of having health insurance on self-reported health status for a population with subsidized insurance plan choices under the Affordable Care Act."

Purchase quality was measured using a healthy purchasing index (HPI).  Findings using propensity score matching procedures indicate that WIC foods explain the improvement in quality of food purchases, not self-selection of more nutrition-conscious households into the program.  Households participating in WIC have a higher HPI in comparison to eligible non-participating households.  Importantly, this difference is driven entirely by WIC participating households who redeemed WIC foods during the interview week. There was no significant difference between WIC-participants who did not redeem WIC foods and eligible non-participants. The paper also examines whether geographic barriers limit WIC participation.  Locations of WIC clinics were added to the already detailed FoodAPS information on food store locations.  There is no evidence in this sample that access to clinics is adversely affecting participation nor is there evidence that HPI depends on supermarket access.  Finally, a supervised machine learning process supports our main conclusion that WIC-provided foods are the driver of increased HPI, not self-selection of healthier households into the program."

A farm-household model is developed to identify an &quot;Income Share Effect&quot; (ISE), which provides a new risk-based explanation rooted in the Chinese context for the inverse relationship. The prevalence of very small plots implies that most farm households have surplus labor and dedicate significant time to non-farm activities. As farm size increases, farmers shift labor away from low-risk, off-farm activities and devote more time to risky farming. Land consolidation and the creation of a class of commercial family farms thus increases the share of household income at risk and leads larger farmers to behave more conservatively in farming decisions. In the absence of insurance markets, the land reform policies may thus achieve the goal of land consolidation but at a cost of lower productivity. The introduction of a perfect crop insurance offsets the inverse relationship as larger farmers are able to protect their specialized agricultural portfolio. The study empirically exams for the existence of the inverse relationship in the absence of insurance: a 1 mu increase in farm size causes a 1.6 yuan/mu decrease in the value of yields. This implies that if average land size increases from the sample mean in 2013, which is 67mu/farm, to 100mu/farm in China, total production would decrease by 3%, a considerable magnitude when talking about national food supply. Finally, the availability of crop insurance has a significant positive impact on productivity, allowing farmers to &ldquo;recover&rdquo; the productivity lost due to the inverse relationship."

Using the matching data of city-level traffic congestion and stock block trading in China, we investigate the impact of traffic congestion in trader's city on stock trading including trading price and stock return, and further inspect the role of information. The empirical results indicate that traffic congestion of buyer or seller's city can significantly reduce trading premium rate, and it persists after addressing endogeneity concerns and across different methods. However, the effect of traffic congest is only significant or much larger when there are less public or private information on trading corporations. We also find that buyer in cities with higher traffic congestion will suffer a significant loss after twenty days of trading, and the effect only exists with less information on corporations.&nbsp;span style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;""br //span&nbsp;"

We propose the class of equal-quantile rules that ensure all agents equal probability of being fully satisfied, with the probability bounded by a parameter. If the welfare loss due to unsatisfied demands and wasted resource are both linear, then an equal-quantile rule with a properly chosen parameter always selects the allocation that minimizes the total expected welfare loss. We further show that the class of equal-quantile rules are the only rules satisfying the following properties: consistency, continuity, strong ranking, and ordinality. In particular, ordinality requires the allocation to be invariant under any continuous and non-decreasing transformation of a problem."

The use of Hermite polynomial in approximating the unknown link function provides a convenient framework to conduct both estimation and variable selection. The estimation of the index parameter is formulated from solutions which are obtained by the routine penalized weighted linear regression procedure, where the weights are used in order to tackle the unbounded support of the regressors. The resulting index parameter estimator is shown to be consistent and sparse. The asymptotic normality of the estimator of the index and that of the link function are established. Numerical results show that both the variable selection procedure and the associated estimators perform well in finite samples."

I begin by developing a non-altruistic dynamic contract model, which uses economic benefits to sustain such relationships in the face of long-term incentive problems. I then estimate the parameters of the model using Chinese household survey data. Based on the model, I quantify the effects of the relationships on household economic behaviors. I find that intergenerational relationships increase the labor supply of young females by 32% and increase old households' savings by 13%. My policy experiments check the spillover effects of intergenerational relationships on policy outcomes. I find that delaying the retirement age reduces the labor supply of young females and that raising inheritance taxes increases the savings of older households. The results indicate that intergenerational relationships have significant effects on households' economic decisions and important implications for public policy."

Our empirical analysis also find that the weak economic prospect leads to the surge of housing prices by stimulating firms' demand for financial (especially housing) assets. Motivated by those facts, we take an off-the-shelf Dynamic New Keynesian model with a novel modeling on firm's dynamic portfolio choice between physical and financial investments. The housing assets earn positive return and can be used as collateral for the firm's external finance. A negative productivity shock dampens the relative return of production capital, therefore more firms have incentives to hold housing assets, leading to a boom in house prices. A rise in house prices produces competing effects on the real investments: it not only raises firm's leverage due to the higher collateral value, but also depresses firm's demand for physical capital because of the crowding-out effects. After calibrating the model to Chinese economy, our quantitative exercise shows that the crowding-out effect dominates the collateral effect of housing boom on physical investments, resulting in a counter-cyclical housing prices. To stabilize aggregate economy and housing market, our counterfactual analysis of policy evaluations reveals that, a capital subsidization policy targeting house prices perform better than the monetary and the deleveraging policies./spanp class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0cm;mso-char-indent-count:0;line-height:normal;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none""span lang=""EN-US"" style=""mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:CMR10;mso-fareast-font-family:宋体;mso-bidi-font-family:CMR10;mso-font-kerning:0pt""o:p/o:p/span&nbsp;"

Using China&rsquo;s unique M&amp;A setting, this paper provides evidence on difference of the ability to meet clients&rsquo; requirements in M&amp;As among top financial advisors. In this paper, we divide M&amp;A acquirers into an opportunistic group and a non-opportunistic group: the former includes firms pursuing public listing through reverse merger or obtaining refinancing qualification, who attach greater importance to complete the deals; the latter involves firms aiming for operational synergy, who place more weight on the M&amp;A performance. We illustrate that top financial advisors working for non-opportunistic firms offer better M&amp;A performance, while those working for opportunistic firms have higher M&amp;A completion rate. Overall, we show that top financial advisors do pay attention to client requirements and perform accordingly in an incentive-compatibility setting."

To attack these problems, we propose a new proposal on knockoff filter, called as graphical knockoff filter, to consider the high-dimensional linear regression model with the Gaussian random design. &nbsp;We can obtain the efficient estimator of the precision matrix based on the estimation theory of ultra-large Gaussian graphical models, which can help us to construct the cheap knockoff variable beautifully as a control group in the high-dimensional setting. It is important that the graphical knockoff procedure can directly be used to select the significant variable with nonzero coefficients efficiently while bounding the FDR under the help of Lasso solution. The properties of the proposed graphical knockoff procedures are investigated both theoretically and numerically. It is shown that the proposed graphical knockoff procedure asymptotically controls the FDR at the target level $q$ and has the higher statistical power. Compared to the existing methods, simulation results show that the proposed graphical knockoff procedure performs well numerically in terms of both the empirical false discovery rate (eFDR) and power of the test. A real data is analyzed to assess the performance of the proposed graphical knockoff procedure./font/span"

In this paper we focus on the case of China. Under the current system, within province admissions are determined by a college entrance exam. But as tests scores are not comparable across provinces, universities must assign separate admission quotas to different provinces. A generally held belief is that elite universities in Beijing and Shanghai discriminate against out-of-province students.We investigate how elite Chinese universities choose between applicants from different provinces. We construct a model of that captures the key features of the Chinese system. In our model, universities care about student quality, but may disagree over the student quality in different provinces. We show that in equilibrium each university should set admission quotas to equalize the marginal student quality in different provinces. This implies that a university should assign a bigger quota to a province where the university is popular or where the student quality is higher.We estimate the model using the quotas and cutoff scores of one hundred top Chinese colleges. We find that different universities tend to rank the student quality in different provinces similarly. If one university considers the average student quality in one province is higher than that in another province, then other universities are likely to consider the same. There are sizable disparities in average student quality across provinces. In particular, provinces with higher pre-college education spending, including Beijing and Shanghai, have significantly higher student quality. Higher ranked universities and those directly under provincial control tends to bias in favor of home students, but the magnitude of the bias is small. Counterfactual experiments show that regional inequalities in admissions is driven largely by the disparities in student quality."

We conducted a randomized field experiment among 303 prefecture-level cities and test whether social comparison can nudge bureaucrats into providing more environmental information. The city governments are randomly divided into three groups: the control group receiving the information request only; the parallel comparison group additionally being informed that seven other cities have posted relevant information online; the upward comparison group being told that the applicant has successfully requested similar information from the province government. The two treatment groups are not more likely to release information with one exception &ndash; when there is considerable ambiguity on whether the information is legal to disclose, the upward comparison increases the likelihood of disclosure."

This paper investigates how informal institution affects the incidence of child labor in rural China. Using genealogy as a proxy for clan culture, we find that a household that keeps a genealogy has significant lower incidence of child labor for boys, but not for girls. This reflects the patriarchal nature of clan in China."

When doctors are gross substitutes, competitive equilibria always exist under mild assumptions unless the government imposes other types of constraints. Competitive equilibrium allocations of a market under interval constraints are also those of an unconstrained market with a certain government transfer policy. For markets with interval constraints and beyond, new techniques help demonstrate comparative statics./span/span/span/span"

Moreover, this effect is more pronounced for small firms, firms with large control potentials, or in weak legal or financial environments. Finally, in a sample of listed family firms, we resort to the presence of movers to separate the inherited and environmental components of clan culture and to demonstrate further that our results are not driven by omitted variables by controlling for prefecture fixed effects."

We reveal a hidden iterative removal structure behind such deferred acceptance algorithms. A nonempty set of students is called a top fair set (TFS) if when all students apply to their most preferred schools and all schools accept the best applicants up to their quotas, students in the set are always accepted, independent of other students&rsquo; preferences. We provide an elimination process to find the maximal TFS, if any TFS exists. We show that for any priority structure, iterative removal of TFS always produces a complete assignment if and only if the associated deferred acceptance algorithm is Pareto efficient, or equivalently, if and only if the priority structure is acyclic. Furthermore, for any such priority structure, the assignment made by iteratively removing TFS coincides with that of the deferred acceptance algorithm.&nbsp;"

Using the panel data at the province level of China from 1984 to 2012, we find that economic growth and inequality are positively correlated, after controlling for the standard determinant variables of growth. In order to better understand the channels that give rise to this correlation, we examine the growth mechanisms as outlined in the unified growth theory (Golar and Moav, 2004), according to which economic growth is driven by physical capital accumulation in the first stage before transiting to the second stage where human capital gradually becomes the main driving force. Our estimation results from the panel-data models and system GMM show that the positive relationship between inequality and growth in post-reform China largely arises from the channel of physical capital accumulation, in spite of a negative impact of inequality on growth arising from the human capital channel. These findings suggest that the performance of Chinese economy in the post-reform era is consistent with the early stage of modern growth whereby high investment and physical capital accumulation provide the main driver for both rising income inequality and economic growth./span/spanp class=""MsoNormal""span lang=""EN-US""o:p/o:p/span"

In the first step, exploiting the structure of logit choice probabilities, we transform the full demand system into a partial linear model and estimate the fixed (non-random) coefficients using standard linear sieve GMM. In the second step, we construct a sieve MD/GMM estimator to uncover the distribution of random coefficients nonparametrically. We establish the asymptotic properties of the estimator and show the semi-nonparametric identification of the model in a large market environment. Monte Carlo simulations and empirical illustrations support the theoretical results and demonstrate the usefulness of our estimator in practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

The QCTE enables us to carry out an ex-ante assessment of distributional impacts of policy interventions, or conduct a meta-analysis to investigate possible explanations for treatment effect heterogeneity. Assuming unconfoundedness and the invariance of the conditional distributions of the potential outcomes, the QCTE is identified and can be nonparametrically estimated by a kernel-based method. Viewed as a random function over the continuum of quantile indices, the estimator converges weakly to a zero mean Gaussian process at the parametric rate. We then propose a multiplier bootstrap procedure to construct uniform confidence bands and provide similar results for the counterfactually treated subpopulation and the average effects. As an empirical application, we estimate the QCTE of the Job Corps training program in the U.S.&nbsp;under various scenarios. Our results suggest that the strong economic performance indeed explains the earlier finding in the literature that the program was ineffective at low quantiles of the earnings distribution. However, no supportive evidence is found for the skill hypothesis."

A coordinated mobility system is deeply connected to and will have profound impacts on all types of infrastructure and the living environment such as urban air quality and public health./span/spanspan lang=""EN-US"" style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 21.6pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';""span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;;mso-fareast-language:&#10;ZH-CN""o:p/o:p/span/spanspan lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;;mso-fareast-language:&#10;ZH-CN""Gao&rsquo;s research and teaching focus on the nexus of transportation, environment, and health systems.

This paper considers a treatment effect model in which treatment effects may be heterogeneous, even among observationally identical individuals. Specifically, extending the classical instrumental variables (IV) model with an endogenous binary treatment and a binary instrument, we allow the heteroskedasticity of the error disturbance to also depend upon the treatment variable so that treatment has both mean and variance effects on the outcome. In this endogenous heteroskedasticity IV (EHIV) model with heterogeneous individual treatment effects, the standard IV estimator can be inconsistent and lead to incorrect inference. After showing identification of the mean and variance treatment effects in a nonparametric version of the EHIV model, we provide closed-form estimators for the linear EHIV for the mean and variance treatment effects and the individual treatment effects (ITE). Asymptotic properties of the estimators are provided. A Monte Carlo simulation investigates the performance of the proposed approach, and an empirical application regarding the effects of fertility on female labor supply is considered."

Approximately one third of epilepsy patients do not respond to antiepileptic drug treatment and have to revert to surgical removal of the tissues generating seizures in the patient&rsquo;s brain. Post-operative seizure freedom largely depends the accurate localization and delineation of the seizure-generating sites. Seizure localization is typically based on visual inspection by epileptologists of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded at multiple sites on the scalp or brain of an epilepsy patient. Automated statistical algorithms will improve the chance of surgical success for patients without direct access to epileptologists. Due to the level of noise present in epileptic scalp EEGs, computational algorithms for seizure localization need to stay robust under&nbsp;amplitude and frequency disturbances. Building on elements of computational topology, we advance a spectral permutation test for comparing single-trial epileptic EEG signals via their topological features in the time domain. We also propose performance criteria via topological invariance to ensure that the exploratory framework stays robust under non-topological changes in signals. Simulation studies and a multichannel data application demonstrate the potential utility oftopological features in seizure localization and beyond."

It has been widely argued that the crisis and recession were caused by &quot;greed&quot; and the failure of mainstream economics. In Getting It Wrong, leading economist William Barnett argues instead that there was too little use of the relevant economics, especially from the literature on economic measurement. Barnett contends that as financial instruments became more complex, the simple-sum monetary aggregation formulas used by central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, became obsolete. Instead, a major increase in public availability of best-practice data was needed. Households, firms, and governments, lacking the requisite information, incorrectly assessed systemic risk and significantly increased their leverage and risk-taking activities. Better financial data, Barnett argues, could have signaled the misperceptions and prevented the erroneous systemic-risk assessments. When extensive, best-practice information is not available from the central bank, increased regulation can constrain the adverse consequences of ill-informed decisions. Instead, there was deregulation. The result, Barnett argues, was a worst-case toxic mix: increasing complexity of financial instruments, inadequate and poor-quality data, and declining regulation. Following his accessible narrative of the deep causes of the crisis and the long history of private and public errors, Barnett provides technical appendixes, containing the mathematical analysis supporting his arguments."

Our estimates show that, after accounting for cyclical fluctuation in the relative price of capital inputs, fifteen of the sixteen countries in the comparison had higher levels of capital input relative to the United States in 2011 than at the beginning of the sample period in 1973.

However, there is no experimental evidence showing that education interventions improve individual economic rationality. We examine this hypothesis by exploiting a randomized one-year financial support program for education in Malawi that reduced absence and dropout rates and increased scores on a qualification exam of female secondary school students. We measured economic rationality 4 years after the intervention using lab-in-the-field experiments to create scores of consistency with utility maximization that are derived from revealed preference theory. We find that those treated had higher scores of economic rationality. The results remain robust after controlling for changes in cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Our results suggest that education enhances the quality of economic decision-making."

To account for these empirical regularities, we introduce capital accumulation, endogenous government spending and taxation into an otherwise standard quantitative sovereign default model. We develop a novel numerical method to solve the equilibrium. The baseline economy is calibrated to match the macroeconomic dynamics of the average economy in our data-set. We use this model to explore how various political friction (government spending and / or taxation rigidity, etc.) and financial frictions (capital quality loss, etc.) affect the government's decision whether to default on their debt obligation or not, and the feedback effects of their fiscal policy on macroeconomic activities."

This positive association is stronger among firms that are either state-owned or receiving government subsidies. However, when the firms that the analysts follow have high overseas sales (top 5% in the sample), foreign analysts can outperform local analysts in forecast accuracy and the foreign analysts&rsquo; superior accuracy is greater as they report more on topics pertaining to financial and profitability ratios of the firms.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

This paper investigates the potential causes of this treatment gap from the perspective of economics. Specifically, we hypothesize that people with mental illness face four major hurdles in obtaining appropriate healthcare, namely the high nonmonetary cost due to stigma, the high out-of-pocket payment due to insufficient public funds devoted to mental health, the high time costs due to low mental healthcare resource availability, and the low treatment benefit due to slow technology diffusion. We use China as a study setting to show country-specific evidence. Our analysis supports the above theoretical argument on the four barriers to access, which in turn sheds light on the effective approaches to mitigate the treatment gap. Four policy options are then discussed, including an information campaign for mental health awareness, increasing public investment in primary mental healthcare resources, transforming the healthcare system towards an integrated people-centered system and capitalizing on e-health technologies."

The greater the positive (negative) distance between the short-run average and the long-run one, the greater (lower) is the expected return. The corresponding strategy yields reliable profits that do not decay even after several months and that survive modern factor models and reasonable transaction costs. The distance also reliably predicts returns at the market and industry levels, as well as in international settings. We propose and provide supporting evidence for the notion that large deviations of prices from their long-run moving averages represent surprises relative to prevailing anchors to which investors react insufficiently."

Entrepreneurs are heteroge-neous in investment efficiency and face credit constraints. They can trade bubble assets to raise their net worth. The bubble assets command a liquidity premium and can have a positive value. Monetary policy affects the conditions for the existence of a bubble, its steady-state size, and its dynamics including the initial size. The leaning-against-the-wind interest rate policy reduces bubble volatility, but could raise inflation volatility. Whether monetary policy should respond to asset bubbles depends on the particular interest rate rule and exogenous shocks."

Oligopoly competition in successive industries is shown to give rise to a vertical externality and a horizontal externality. If a collusive price of intermediate goods better balances the two externalities, the collusion will raise the joint profit of all firms in the two industries and is therefore profitable for the upstream without hurting the downstream. We further link the profitability of such collusions to industry characteristics in terms of demand, cost, and competition intensity.&nbsp;"

That said, little is known about how changes to the centralized admissions policies impacts the allocation of students to colleges (majors). This paper uses a novel dataset from the University of Costa Rica (UCR) to address this question. A central challenge in doing so is recovering students' preferences over final assignments. The reason is that much like many centralized admissions systems, UCR restricts the number of options a student can report. This gives students an incentive to manipulate their reports. We propose a new methodology to recover a minimal set of preferences that are consistent with the data. To achieve this, we treat the students' decision problem as one associated with a large population, and impose two minimal rationality conditions on students' reports. We apply this methodology to the UCR dataset and use the recovered preferences to address counterfactuals. We show that 72% of the students receive a different allocation from what they would receive if they reported their full preference ranking (the benchmark). Finally, we consider alternate mechanisms for allocating students to seats. We show that a mechanism based on an ascending auction does not generate large distortions. Under that mechanism, only 6% of the students receive a different assignment from the benchmark. Moreover, it only reduces the aggregate welfare from the benchmark in 1%"

We allow for the distribution of the measurement error to be unknown, but assume that there is an independent sample from the measurement error distribution. The sample from the measurement error distribution need not be independent from the sample on response and predictor variables. The availability of a sample from the measurement error distribution is satisfied if, for example, either 1) validation data or 2) repeated measurements (panel data) on the latent predictor variable with measurement errors, one of which is symmetrically distributed, are available. The proposed confidence band builds on the deconvolution kernel estimation and a novel application of the multiplier (or wild) bootstrap method. We establish asymptotic validity of the proposed confidence band under ordinary smooth measurement error densities, showing that the proposed confidence band contains the true regression function with probability approaching the nominal coverage probability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to derive asymptotically valid uniform confidence bands for nonparametric errors-in-variables regression. We also propose a novel data-driven method to choose a bandwidth, and conduct simulation studies to verify the finite sample performance of the proposed confidence band. Applying our method to a combination of two empirical data sets, we draw confidence bands for nonparametric regressions of medical costs on the body mass index (BMI), accounting for measurement errors in BMI. Finally, we discuss extensions of our results to specification testing, cases with additional error-free regressors, and confidence bands for conditional distribution functions."

Exploiting this observation, we use a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model to study quantitatively the effect of housing consumption externalities (&ldquo;keeping up with the Zhangs&rdquo;) on house price dynamics. Our Bayesian estimation reveals that housing consumption externalities have a significant role in house price dynamics, amplifying the response of house prices to shocks. Time-invariant transaction taxes that designed to offset the effects of keeping up with the Zhangs can significantly reduce the impacts of housing demand shocks on housing prices."

Social communication crowds out information production as a result of agent&rsquo;s temptation to free ride on the signals purchased by their neighbors. Although information exchange among traders increases trading volume, improves liquidity and enhances the ability of asset prices to re?ect the aggregate amount of informa-tion in the market, it fails to improve price  informativeness. Net earnings are higher with information sharing due to reduced acquisition of costly signals."

The first one is the share of routine manual jobs decreased from 56.65% to 31.58%, the second one is the share of non-employment increase from 15.85% to 30.75%, and the last one is the share of routine cognitive jobs increased from 8.17% to 19.27%. Our decomposition exercises find that the composition effect, the propensity effect and the interaction effect contribute to 67.6%, 66.4% and -34% to the fall in routine manual jobs, respectively. Meanwhile, these effects for the rise in routine cognitive jobs and for the increase in the not-working are 15.6%, 73.5%, 10.9%, and 6.9%, 92.8%, 0.3%, respectively. The pattern of change in employment structure and decomposition results in China are somewhat differ from those in developed countries, such as the United States."

The justification is often that stationarity is a reasonable approximation to the true state of dependence if we focus on spatial data &quot;locally.&quot; In this talk, we first review various known approaches for modeling nonstationary spatial data.

To illustrate, we will focus on the multi-fractional Brownian motion, for which a thorough analysis could be conducted assuming data are observed on a regular grid.

We demonstrate that highly productive firms are less export oriented compared with less productive ones. This negative correlation between firm productivity and export intensity among exporters remains robust when we control firm ownership, factor intensity, and rule out impacts of processing trade. In order to rationalize our empirical findings, we extend the Arkolakis (2010) model to allow marketing cost elasticities to be heterogeneous across markets. A higher marketing cost elasticity domestically gives rise to a faster sales expansion in the home market as firm productivity grows. The fact that this negative correlation is more pronounced among firms who belong to advertising intensive industries supports the model predictions. Further evidence helps to rule out alternative explanations such as the effects of variable markup and product quality./span"

The analysis faces though a dimensionality problem since the dynamic dependence structure is complex yet of extremely sparse nature. We propose a Sparse Group Network AutoRegressive (SGNAR) model. We present a regu-larized estimator which copes both group and individual sparsity to investigate the essential dependence in the blockchain transactions. This allows us to detect active groups with influential impact on the global network. Underlying BTC network dynamic effects in year to year show signs for the blockchain being in an adoption phase. Effects are identified coming from Europe and North America, yet only in the recent years, while surprisingly Asia does not affect the transaction network."

First, banks incur an early liquidation cost caused by bank runs, and they fail to fully internalize this negative effect on social resource. Second, banks do not take into account the excessive volatility jointly caused by the banks' amplification effect on shocks and the possibility of bank runs. When the central bank uses nominal interest rate as instrument, expansionary monetary policies can aggravate banks' overborrowing feature, increasing the probability of bank runs.

Our identification strategy is to compare the winning and losing cities of the National Football League (NFL) conference championship games under the assumption of similar pretrends. We use the stock market performance of public companies headquartered in these cities to capture the changing prospects of local economies attributable to Super Bowl participation. The exogenous variation in football game outcomes allows for a straightforward difference-in-differences approach to identify the causal effect. We show that the post-event trends in winning and losing cities diverge despite their similar trends before the end of the regular season. Our empirical results indicate that winning the NFL conference championship game, thus the opportunity to compete in the Super Bowl, has a positive, significant effect on the local economy, particularly the manufacturing and FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate) sectors. A similar analysis of winning the Super Bowl, however, finds no further significant effect on the local economy."

This paper diagnoses the phenomenon and proposes contractual and regulatory solutions to ameliorate the situation. Existing research (e.g., Becker (1957), Coate and Loury (1993)) studies a situation in which an individual person practices discrimination. In contrast, this paper considers a hierarchical organization in which a manager (the agent) may or may not have a discriminatory taste toward his subordinates, whereas an owner (the principal), who is ignorant of the manager&rsquo;s taste and sub-ordinate workers&rsquo; productivity levels, is unbiased and only cares about profit. In this environment, I study a direct mechanism and characterize an optimal contract. Additionally, I compare the allocation implemented by the optimal direct mechanism to the first-best (full information) allocation and discuss the effectiveness of current regulations (e.g., affirmative action): I find that a regulator (such as the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) can improve compliance with non-discriminatory conduct, despite the fact that the person on whom the regula-tion is directly incident&mdash;the principal&mdash;is not intrinsically biased. I also show that the regulation can be counter-productive if it attempts to enforce perfect fairness (the ?rst-best allocation) when that allocation is not incentive feasible. Finally, I review the U.S. law of discrimination and analyze statutory and jurisprudential issues regarding the optimal mechanism."

There are three contributions in this paper. First, it is found that timeout, rebound, score, foul and turnover can significantly affect the strength of momentum. Second, in the analysis of the influential factors of momentum, it is found that when slope as the momentum, there is a clear home advantage, while the home advantage does not stand out when time as the momentum. Third, momentum can significantly affect the winning percentage of the game, so factors can be used to predict the outcome of the game in the future."

We focused on the differences in reporting pollution events between party and nonparty newspapers to illuminate the impact of government control. Compared with less regulated and more commercialized nonparty newspapers, party newspapers were 30% less likely to report local water pollution but were more likely to report upstream pollution. Party newspapers were also more likely to underreport water pollution caused by state-owned companies, suggesting that local governments&rsquo; incentives to control media are related to their liability. Using keywords from Reports on the Work of the Government by provincial governments from 2004 to 2013, we show that party newspapers&rsquo; tendency to underreport pollution became stronger after government strengthening of media control. The difference between party and nonparty newspapers in reporting pollution was robust when water quality and market forces were added to the models. It was also robust when we tested other report aspects, such as word count, time lag, and front-page placement (or not). However, there were no significant differences in reporting other events, such as floods."

We use the type and actual time stamps of 9.3 million credit card transactions by over 200,000 card holders to identify non-work-related transactions during work hours. After positive shocks to house prices, treated individuals experienced an immediate and permanent increase (by 8% per month) in their propensity to use credit cards for non-work-related transactions during work hours. We do not find any effect for workers in the neighboring, unaffected cities or among retirees and the unemployed in the &ldquo;shocked&rdquo; cities. The post-shock response is driven by homeowners, with an even greater impact among owners with a higher housing wealth (i.e., those with multiple homes). Renters, on the other hand, experienced no change in the post-shock period. Consistent with increased shirking and lower productivity interpretation, further analyses find no evidence of the treatment group working harder in other hours of the day and moreover the response is stronger among workers with lower work incentives. Overall, findings in this paper provide novel insight on the real impact of housing booms by influencing work effort choices."

Building on this evidence, we develop and structurally estimate a multidimensional equilibrium model allowing for trade-offs between cultural distance, legal status, and other spouses' characteristics. The results suggest that immigrants are willing to trade-off cultural proximity for legal status, and to marry down on other individual traits for that purpose."

We investigate the HQ relocations of two different motivations, distinguished by different destinations: relocations to the capital city of Beijing in search of political favouritism, and relocations to Shanghai or Shenzhen seeking for a strengthened market competitiveness. Specifically, firms that relocate their headquarters to Beijing seem to receive certain political favour, while firms that relocate to Shanghai or Shenzhen have experienced no such impact. Empirical results show that the HQ relocations, motivated by political and market reasons alike, would generally improve the firm&rsquo;s accounting performance. The improvement in the stock performance, however, only occurs to firms that relocated their headquarters to Shanghai or Shenzhen. The differences in the stock performance might be attributed to the harm of the political favouritism to firms&rsquo; sustainability: HQ relocation to Beijing reduces efficiency (TFP) and innovation (R&amp;D and patents). Moreover, we also find that HQ relocations to Beijing generate negative externalities to the rival firms and to the entire industry. These findings show that political favouritism distorts the spatial distribution of economic activities and leads to an inefficient resource allocation."

The high-minus-low hedge portfolio earns the excess return of 72 basis points per month, the characteristic-adjusted return of 66 basis points per month, and the industry-adjusted return of 79 basis points per month. They are all economically substantial and statistically highly significant. We show that asymmetric variance premium is closely related to skewness premium.

Using the suf-ficient statistics approach, we derive a formula for the social welfare loss caused by the OCP-induced lower fertility and marriage distortion, and it only depends on the estimated reduced-form elasticities. Our estimates imply that the welfare loss caused by lowered fertility and marriage distortion is 2.6 and 1.1 percent of annual household income, respectively."

However, there is relative under-supply of theory accounting for these facts. To bridge the gap, we develop a unified general equilibrium banking model with heterogeneous firms to analyze the misallocation consequences of credit expansion policy both within and across sectors. The main insight is the trade-off between credit quantity and quality. On the one hand, a moderate credit expansion has a non-monotonic impact on the aggregate output. It raises credit potentially available for production at the cost of more severe productivity distortion. On the other hand, a sufficiently large credit expansion may trigger an interbank market crisis, generating the discontinuous effect. The resulting economic recession is exacerbated by the firm-level productivity misallocations. By extending the static model to a dynamic environment, we show that an expansionary credit policy can generate endogenous boom-bust business cycles despite the absence of adverse shocks."

A policy maximizing the sum of individual incomes may not be desirable if it magnifies economic inequality and post-treatment redistribution of income is infeasible. This paper develops a method to estimate the optimal treatment assignment policy based on observable individual covariates when the policy objective is to maximize an equality-minded rank-dependent social welfare function, which puts higher weight on individuals with lower-ranked outcomes. We estimate the optimal policy by maximizing a sample analog of the rank-dependent welfare over a properly constrained set of policies. Although an analytical characterization of the optimal policy under a rank-dependent social welfare is not available even with the knowledge of potential outcome distributions, we show that the average social welfare attained by our estimated policy converges to the maximal attainable welfare at n-1/2 rate uniformly over a large class of data distributions. We also show that this rate is minimax optimal. We provide an application of our method using the data from the National JTPA Study."

On the theoretical side, we generalize the Hsieh-Klenow approach. In particular, it illustrates a novel channel through which firm-level misallocation causes sectoral misallocation and, then, aggregate efficiency losses. Using China&rsquo;s tax survey data covering half million manufacturing and service firms, we structurally estimate the model and find: (i) TFP, markups and wedges are all positively correlated and (ii) the correlations are much stronger in the service sector. These findings suggest severe sectoral misallocation in China. When the correlation between firm TFP and wedges are hypothetically reduced to the extent observed in the manufacturing sector, we find labor reallocation of 6 percentage points from manufacturing to service and an aggregate welfare gain of 10 percent. In contrast, the Hsieh-Klenow formula would imply zero sectoral labor reallocation and much smaller welfare gain."

Immunosuppressants relax biological constraints between patients and donors, allowing patients to receive transplants from any donor. Given the limited availability, we propose how to assign immunosuppressants and how to match patients to donors to facilitate transplants. We ask whether there exist Pareto efficient solutions that satisfy additional requirements of monotonicity and maximal improvement. We propose modi?cations of the top-trading cycles solutions to achieve these requirements. To quantify the welfare improvement as per our proposal, we conduct counterfactual analyses using transplant data from South Korea. Our result suggests that the current use of immunosuppressants could have been reduced by 55 percent."

This paper merges Chinese exporters with their overseas patents and studies how overseas patents facilitate Chinese firms' exports. Export values are found to be positively associated with the number of patents that export destination countries grant to exporters. This association is mainly driven by the positive correlation between the number of overseas patents and the quantity of exports, rather than between overseas patents and export prices. Furthermore, the positive relationships between export values and quantities mainly take effect when the stock of patents issued by destination countries are concentrated in a small number of non-Chinese firms. These results suggest that patents effective in export destination countries allow Chinese firms to expand their export sales there because the litigation risk of patent infringement becomes lower./span/span/spanspan lang=""EN-US"" style=""mso-bidi-font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""o:p/o:p/span"

While investors&rsquo; preference for the jackpot type of payoffs inherent in high distress stocks alone explains the distress anomaly of illiquid stocks, it cannot not explain the difference of the anomaly between &nbsp; liquid and illiquid stocks. Earnings announcement tests show that the difference in better explained by the pricing errors resulted from favorite-longshot bias of noise traders. Our results support the view that there is greater noise trading in liquid stocks, which not only generates greater pricing errors in the distress stocks but also greater limits to arbitrage as described in Shleifer and Summers (1990) and Shleifer and Vishny (1997).&nbsp;"

Our results in the resulting framework provide three main messages: (i) the veil of ignorance im-plies anonymity of tax schemes; (ii) the veil of ignorance generically rejects utilitarian tax schemes; (iii) the veil of ignorance endorses the (Rawlsian) leveling tax scheme."

In each period, the uninformed party (the receiver, i.e. the public/readers) can consult the informed party (the sender, i.e. the media) at a cost. The sender, who is driven by profits, has an incentive to generate uncertainty in order to encourage future consultation. We find that both the sender and receiver can benefit from a higher cost of consultation, which dampens the sender's responsiveness to uncertainty and allows him to commit to similar likelihood of (re)consultation conditional on different messages, thereby reducing the sender's incentive to misreport."

Less attention has been paid to the effects of the housing boom on renters, who make up over 30% of US households. In this paper, I use detailed credit information from a sample of almost 500,000 US consumers to show that house price growth reduced renter credit access during the last housing boom. In particular, banks reduced non-mortgage credit supply when they expanded mortgage lending to homeowners. As a consequence, renters living in locations where banks had more (national) geographic exposure to the housing boom ended up borrowing less but defaulting more. The results are especially pronounced in locations with stronger credit market frictions, as measured by local banks' mortgage retention probability and balance sheet liquidity, or bank cost of funds in the local market. The effects of the housing boom on the borrowing and default behavior of renters persisted during the subsequent recession. This research suggests that policies affecting house prices and mortgage financing have broader implications for less well-off households that do not own a home."

The local adaptive method (LAM) selects local homogeneous intervals through a backward testing procedure on a set of nested intervals, which is proved to be excellent in forecasting in many cases due to parameter stability. However, the LAM may not efficiently utilize pre-break information when a recently detected break is small. We design a dynamic adaptive method (DAM) with cross-validation on multiple sets of nested intervals. The DAM ensures the possibility of selecting longer intervals under small breaks or smooth changes to increase information efficiency, thus to improve the balance between bias and variance. Our simulation study shows that the DAM outperforms alternative methods, including the LAM, the rolling window selection method of Inoue et al. (2017), the pooled forecast of Pesaran and Timmermann (2007) and the ex-post best rolling window. A forecast application on the Chinese CPI inflation not only demonstrates its superiority with respect to the alternative methods, but also beats a well-known survey forecast.&nbsp;!--EndFragment--"

Depending on the educational investment parents make and the relocation cost of children, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for migrant parents to take their children to migrate and whether they should provide their children with private education. Secondly, we investigate weather migrant children&rsquo;s school performances are better than those of the left-behind ones. &nbsp;Empirical evidence based on the 2009 wave of the Rural-Urban Migration Survey in China (RUMiC) data suggests that younger migrant children's school performances are better than those of left-behind children.

As an effective inferential tool, Efron's confidence distribution (CD) has attracted a surge of renewed attention. The essence in constructing confidence distribution pertains to the availability of suitable pivotal quantities, which are usually obtained from the (asymptotic) distribution of point maximum likelihood estimator. We propose to use inference function, from which the parameter is obtained, as the basis of constructing the pivotal. The proposed method, termed as merged estimating function analytics (MEFA), inherits several advantages of inference function over the traditional likelihood reduced score function. We show that the proposed MEFA is a special case of the generalized method of moments (GMM). Thus, MEFA, which includes maximum likelihood estimation as a special case, provides us a unified framework for many kinds of statistic methods, which is illustrated via numerical examples in the context of divide-and-combine approaches to Big Data analysis. &nbsp;/span/span/span"

An emerging literature estimates air pollution&rsquo;s effects on labor productivity but only for small groups of workers of particular occupations or firms. To provide more comprehensive estimates necessary for policy analysis, we estimate effects for all but some small firms (90% of China&rsquo;s manufacturing output) and capture all channels by which pollution influences productivity. We instrument for reverse causality between pollution and output using thermal inversions.br /br /Our causal estimates imply that a one ??g/m3 decrease in PM2.5 (SO2) increases labor productivity by 0.011% (0.036%) with an elasticity of -0.58 (-0.54). Lowering PM2.5 (SO2) by 1% nationwide through methods other than reducing manufacturing output would generate annual productivity increases of CNY 74.1 (69.7) thousand for the average firm and CNY 11.8 (11.1) billion or 0.079% (0.075%) of GDP across all firms. Improving air quality generates substantial productivity benefits and these should be considered in evaluating environmental regulations and their effect on firm competitiveness."

While the literature has paid considerable attention to the other two policy instruments, theoretical work on how income taxation could minimize working poverty is scarce. Our study aims to fill this gap. Unlike the traditional optimal income taxation literature, which considers that households allocate time only between consumption and leisure, we explicitly model the decision of households as including domestic work, which is a social contribution and should be rewarded. This new framework highlights (i) the importance of emphasizing the difference between domestic work and real leisure and, (ii) the policy implications of non-market time allocation.br /br clear=""all"" /&nbsp;"

We introduce a method to integrate the three conventional estimators --- the regression adjustment estimator, the inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimator, and the doubly robust (DR) estimator --- into a single three-in-one (TIO) estimator. The TIO estimator is all three of them: it is a regression estimator, an IPW estimator, and a DR estimator. From an empirical point of view, this removes the burden from having to choose one of the three estimators. In finite samples, the TIO estimator outperforms the three conventional estimators."

We consider a model where agents play a discrete game with complete information whose equilibrium actions (i.e., binary treatments) determine a post-game outcome in a nonseparable model with endogeneity. Due to the simultaneity in the first stage, the model as a whole is incomplete and the selection process fails to exhibit the conventional monotonicity. Without imposing parametric restrictions or large support assumptions, this poses challenges in recovering treatment parameters. To address these challenges, we first analytically characterize regions that predict equilibria in the ?rst-stage game with possibly more than two players, whereby we ?nd a certain monotonic pattern of these regions. Based on this ?nding, we derive bounds on the average treatment effects (ATE&rsquo;s) under nonparametric shape restrictions and the existence of excluded variables. We also introduce and point identify a multi-treatment version of local average treatment effects (LATE&rsquo;s)."

These results are robust to a quasi-natural experiment using the implementation of TRACE as an exogenous shock to bond market liquidity, and an instrumental variable regression controlling for the endogeneity of bond liquidity. Further investigation shows that the effect of liquidity is more pronounced in firms subject to more credit supply frictions, firms with poorer credit ratings and more rollover risk, and firms relying more on debt financing.&nbsp;"

This leads to IV/GMM/OLS estimation of a dynamic linear probability model (LPM) with fixed effects. In this paper, I give a set of pros and cons of this procedure using explicit analytical results, some simulations, and an empirical application. I find that this procedure should be treated with caution, especially in fixed- T settings. In large-T settings, existing procedures cannot be directly applied. As a consequence, I give guidance as to what choices researchers should make in both these settings."

The model economy learns new technology from the world frontier, and reallocates resources to fit the technological change. When a firm starts to catch up the frontier, it faces the uncertainty of future technical progress, and delays the adjustment of production factors as a response. The delayed adjustment generates allocative inefficiency in the early stage of development. Then, technological achievement narrows the gap to the frontier, reduces the future uncertainty, and improves the efficiency. Finally, the economy reaches an more efficient distribution again in the new steady state. The model suggests that the cross-country difference in allocative efficiency can be a byproduct of the different stages of development."

Monte Carlo simulations show good small sample performance of the proposed tests. The empirical section applies the tests to study the impact of attending a better high school and discover interesting patterns of treatment effect heterogeneity neglected by previous studies."

Netting out these channels, a 100-percent increase in commercial land prices leads to an estimated loss of 9.5 percent to aggregate TFP due to misallocation of capital. Our findings caution a widely-held view that real estate booms help to mitigate firms&rsquo; financing constraints and thus boost the economy by stimulating firm investment."

With the aid of an independent attitude survey, we find that (i) in the unfamiliar-context treatment and the context-free treatment people experience the same cognitive dissonance level and we do not observe different behavior in the lab; (ii) in the familiar-context treatment people experience the most intensive cognitive dissonance level among all treatments and subjects are much less likely to behave unethically. Our results unify the mixed findings from past social preference experiments.

Our empirical work shows a few interesting results. First, we discover that the residual variance is significantly and positively related to the average price level achieved by an artist. Second, the residual variance has additional explanatory power in terms of how often the artist&rsquo;s works are cited and exhibited, even after we control for artist fixed (reputation) effects. Third, collectors tend to value more those artworks with higher residual variance. Artworks by those artists with high residual variance tend to outperform the market within and out of sample. One possible explanation of our results is that residual variance could be a proxy for creative risk taking by contemporary artists. The most creative artists dare to take more risks, which results in higher residual price volatility of their artworks."

The rapid growth in data size and dimensionality has urged the need for developing efficient large-scale SVD and PCA algorithms. In recent years, there are emerging new techniques in numerical linear algebra, called randomized algorithms or random sketching, for high dimensional and large scale problems. Randomized SVD based on one-time sketching has been studied, and its potential has been demonstrated for computing a low-rank SVD. Instead of exploring different single random sketching techniques, we propose a Monte Carlo type integrated SVD algorithm based on multiple random sketches. The proposed integration algorithm takes multiple random sketches and then integrates the results obtained from the multiple sketches. The integrated SVD can achieve higher accuracy and lower stochastic variations. For supervised approach, the sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) has been continuing an active research field. When estimating the central subspace (CS), inverse regression based SDR methods involve solving a generalized eigenvalue problem, which can be problematic under the large-p-small-n situation. To overcome the large-p-small-n problem in SDR, we combine the idea of statistical inference with random sketching to propose a new SDR method, called ``integrated random-partition SDR (iRP-SDR)''. Asymptotic properties as well as numerical examples will be provided.&nbsp;/spanp class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph""span lang=""EN-US""o:p/o:p/span"

Our treatments manipulate whether subjects can observe others' forecasts and whether subjects engage in public or private investment decisions. We find that subjects' forecasts significantly converge when shared, though in different directions across groups. Thus, information sharing does not necessarily lead to a better decision. We also observe a strong positive correlation between forecasts and investments, suggesting that an individual's reported forecast is associated with his belief.&nbsp;"

The principal is able to observe the agent's type, but not directly observe effort, and can then provide information to the market, which is competitive and pays the agent his expected valuation. The principal's goal is to pick an information scheme to maximise the agent's utility. For example, the principal could provide full information to the market, but this would expose the agent to the full amount of risk. Alternatively, the principal could provide no information, leading to a market wage that is constant, but leaves the agent with no incentives to exert effort. Thus, the principal faces a trade off between providing incentivizes the agent and smoothing the agent's risk. For an agent with binary types, the optimal information scheme is charaterized for a large class of utility functions. The crucial determinant of the optimal policy is prudence. It is shown that there exists a threshold, such that if the agent's prudence lies above this threshold, then the optimal policy is to reveal a fraction of good types and then pool the other agents. If the agent's prudence lies below this threshold, then optimal policy is to reveal a fraction of bad types and then pool the other agents.&nbsp;"

To capture the very heavy tails of overnight returns, a dynamic conditional score model with t innovations is adopted. We propose a several step estimation procedure that captures the nonparametric slowly moving components by kernel estimation and the dynamic parameters by estimated maximum likelihood. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of our semiparametric estimation procedures. We extend the modelling to the multivariate case where we allow time varying correlation between stocks. We apply our model to the study of the Dow Jones industrial average component stocks over the period 1991-2016 and the CRSP capitalization-based portfolios over the period 1992-2015. We show that the ratio of overnight to intraday volatility has actually increased in importance for Dow Jones stocks during the last two decades. This ratio has also increased for large stocks in CRSP, but decreased for small stocks in CRSP. Notably, the slope increases monotonically from the smallest cap decile to the largest cap decile. The multivariate model shows that overnight and intraday correlations have both increased considerably during this period."

Using the staggered implementation of the EDGAR system in 1993-1996 as a shock to information dissemination technologies, we find evidence that modern information technologies increase information production by corporate outsiders. Specifically, trades by individual investors in a stock become more informative about future stock returns after the stock becomes subject to mandatory filing on EDGAR. This effect is driven primarily by investors who have access to the internet. There is evidence that the amount and accuracy of information produced by sell-side analysts increase following the EDGAR implementation. Market responses to analyst revisions also become stronger after firms become EDGAR filers. Furthermore, stock pricing efficiency improves after a firm becomes an EDGAR filer. Overall, these results suggest that greater and broader information dissemination facilitated by modern information technologies improves information production and stock pricing efficiency.o:p/o:p/span"

We find that in the presence of greater technology spillovers, firms tend to grant longer duration compensation contracts to their executives. This finding is consistent with theoretical predictions by Manso (2011) who argue that firms should choose longer-term contracts to encourage managerial incentives for exploration rather than exploitation. We find this effect to be stronger among younger firms and firms with more growth opportunities. We also find that, in the presence of greater technology spillover, firms are more willing to grant shorter duration contracts when board and institutional monitoring is stronger. We enhance our identification by using exogenous variation in state-level R&amp;D tax credits to identify the effect of technology spillovers. Overall, our findings suggest that technology spillover has a meaningful influence on compensation contracting.&nbsp;"

The new approach is effective for the &ldquo;cold-start&rdquo; problem, where, in the testing set, majority responses are obtained from new users or for new items, and their preference information is not available from the training set. One advantage of the proposed model is that we are able to incorporate information from the missing mechanism and group-specific features through clustering based on the numbers of ratings from each user and other variables associated with missing patterns.&nbsp; Our simulation studies and MovieLens data analysis both indicate that the proposed group-specific method improves prediction accuracy significantly compared to existing competitive recommender system approaches.

The model offers an explanation for the excess smoothness of consumption as well as the negative relationship between income uncertainty and homeownership as documented in data.

Moreover, to satisfy (i)?(iii), if the time horizon is long enough, it is generically su&cent; cient and necessary for social discounting to be more patient than the most patient individual long-run discounting, in which an individual?s long-run discount rate is his asymptotic average and relative discount rate."

As a result, we develop (for the first time) measures of the cross-province effectiveness of xinfang institutions. Using a difference-in-differences methodology, we find that cross-province differences in xinfang are associated with cross-province, cross-industry, and cross-firm differences in corporate financing patterns that are consistent with key predictions from the law and finance view."

Using non-parametric methods, we find that ethnically fragmented reservations have tended to follow the same trend of exclusive growth &ndash; i.e., rising inequality - found elsewhere in the United States.

It is also known in the literature that EL approaches encounter difficulties when dealing with problems having high-dimensional model parameters and estimating equations. To overcome the challenges, we begin our study with a careful investigation on high-dimensional EL from a new scope targeting at estimating a high-dimensional sparse model parameters. We show that the new scope provides an opportunity for relaxing the stringent requirement on the dimensionality of the model parameter. Motivated by the new scope, we then propose a new penalized EL by applying two penalty functions respectively regularizing the model parameters and the associated Lagrange multipliers in the optimizations of EL. By penalizing the Lagrange multiplier to encourage its sparsity, we show that drastic dimension reduction in the number of estimating equations can be effectively achieved without compromising the validity and consistency of the resulting estimators. Most attractively, such a reduction in dimensionality of estimating equations is actually equivalent to a selection among those high-dimensional estimating equations, resulting in a highly parsimonious and effective device for high-dimensional sparse model parameters. Allowing both the dimensionalities of model parameters and estimating equations growing exponentially with the sample size, our theory demonstrates that the estimator from our new penalized EL is sparse and consistent with asymptotically normally distributed nonzero components. Numerical simulations and a real data analysis show that the proposed penalized EL works promisingly./span/span/spanspan lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;""o:p/o:p/span"

We build a simple model of capital competition among units with heterogeneous tax enforcement costs, and rely on the Golden Tax Project, which obviates the need for Chinese local tax agencies to deter tax evasion through onsite inspections, as a natural experiment to test the model predictions. Exploiting the heterogeneous shock that the reform exerts on the fiscal capacity of Chinese counties with different geographic features, we show that the causal effect of a county&rsquo;s fiscal capacity on its market-supporting investment and output respectively is, although positive for counties with the lowest capital mobility, significantly more negative in counties where firms face lower relocation costs. We then provide evidence for the reason why capital mobility decreases the positive economic impact of fiscal capacity: under capital mobility, firms that seek to evade taxes have relocated out of counties that experienced a positive fiscal capacity shock from the reform. Our results imply that tax evasion was a real consideration for Chinese firms in determining where to locate and how much capital to invest in each county. Capital mobility, which tends to erode the complementarity between counties' fiscal capacity and market-supporting infrastructure investment, has an equalizing effect on economic outputs across counties with different fiscal capacity."

The GEL estimator has the same asymptotic dis-tribution as the generalized method of moments estimator explored with same moment conditions for estimation, but circumvents a first step estimation of the optimal weighting matrix with a preliminary estimator, and thus can be robust to unknown heteroskedasticity and non-normality. While a general GEL removes the asymptotic bias from the preliminary estimator and partially removes the bias due to the correlation between the moment conditions and their Jacobian, the empirical likelihood as a special member of GELs further partially removes the bias from estimating the second moment matrix. We also formulate the GEL overidentfication test, Moran's I test, and GEL ratio tests for parameter restrictions and non-nested hypotheses.

We propose a new structural pairwise network model based on individual utility maximization. In this model, the econometrician, as an outsider, witnesses a link if and only if both agents prefer it, while the agent is willing to create a bond with a peer if he or she gains positive individual utility from the potential connection. Besides observed personal attributes, unobservable individual heterogeneity enters the random utility as an additive fixed effect. The fixed effects enhance the applicability of the model, but impose technical challenges as they are buried in nonlinear functions. To identify and estimate the model, we exploit the special panel-data structure. In a network of n individuals, we can view one's linking outcomes to all the n-1 peers as a within-group observation, so that the network provides n overlapping groups. We treat each fixed effect term as an unknown parameter. Under a distributional assumption about the link-specific idiosyncratic shock, we establish consistency and asymptotic distribution for the maximum likelihood estimator of the common parameter. We apply this estimator to study the determinants of gift exchange in a network of village households in China.&nbsp;"

However, if an additional role of money as a medium of exchange is introduced, then the Friedman rule achieves generally suboptimal level of aggregate consumption regardless of agents&rsquo; preferences for the timing of uncertainty resolution. The aggregate output uncertainty, nevertheless, crucially determines the level of optimal in?ation rate in this case.

We use college entrance examination scores as a measure of human capital. This exam is extremely important for Chinese students, since it is almost the only admission requirement for higher education and has crucial influence on a student&rsquo;s future income and career. Exploiting the random fluctuations in temperature across counties, we identify the contemporaneous temperature effects on the exam scores with county fixed effects models. We find that 1&nbsp;supo/supC increase in the maximum temperature on the exam days reduces exam scores by 0.17%, which is equivalent to 1.3 points. Moreover, these contemporaneous effects have longer consequences on human capital accumulation by reducing a student&rsquo;s probability of getting into a better college. We are also exploring the persistent effects of exposure to high temperature during the period in a student&rsquo;s early lives."

The upgrading scheme adds additional space to the existing units and is carried out if sufficient residents vote in favor of the space adding. We identify the willingness to pay for space by comparing the per square meter price of the same property before and after the upgrading to other units that have not gone through upgrading. To further ensure comparable treatment and control groups, we restrict our sample to narrow margins around the voting cut-off. Results indicate that an additional 6 square meters of space added to a 3-room property induces a fall of per square meter price by 6%. We don&rsquo;t find significant evidence for larger properties.&nbsp;"

It is assumed that the individuals form unobserved groups, where the individual effects are the same within a group but heterogeneous across different groups. A penalized regression approach is proposed to identify the latent group structures and the important covariates simultaneously. A new ADMM-CD algorithm is proposed to optimize the objective function. When the sample sizes go to infinity, it is shown that the proposed estimator recovers the latent group structures and the important covariates in probability approaching one. The finite sample performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated through Monte Carlo studies and illustrated with a real data set"

A federation, with the aim of maximizing the aggregate utility of its members, may find it advantageous to decentralize the decision-making, so that its members act autonomously to maximize their own utility. If the political structures are chosen simultaneously, federations that are larger or more sensitive to the public good have more incentives to remain centralized. This is not always true if the political structures are chosen sequentially. A federation that always remains centralized in the simultaneous game may choose to commit to decentralization if it moves first.a href=""/Upload/File/2017/4/20170418105546678.pdf""Upload/File/2017/4/20170418105546678.pdf/a"

Contestants have independent private abilities, and their utility function is additively separable in prizes and effort. The effort-maximizing contest generally requires multiple positive and negative prizes. Low-ability contestants could receive negative prizes, which then generate additional prize money to better incentivize those with suficiently high abilities. But to ensure their participation, when all contestants are of low abilities, they all receive some positive prize regardless of their actual abilities. We find that allowing negative prizes can enhance the total effort dramatically. When contestants are risk neutral, the effort-maximizing mechanism can be implemented by a modified all-pay auction."

We developed hierarchical Bayesian Biomarker Threshold Models to make simultaneous inference on both the cut-points of the biomarker variable and the magnitude of the biomarker-treatment interaction. Hierarchical priors are proposed and used in Markov Chain Monte Carlo for statistical inference. We further implement the proposed method in an R package for Biomarker Threshold Models (&lsquo;bhm&rsquo;).

These firms invest more after cross-listings and realize even higher grow rates than&nbsp;before listings."

We propose procedures for calculating a confidence set for group membership. Recently, Bonhomme and Manresa (2015) develop methods to simultaneously estimate group memberships and group-specific parameters. Our confidence sets can be used to quantify the uncertainty inherent in these estimated group mem- berships. We consider uniform confidence sets that cover the true group membership for all units with a pre-specified probability as well as unitwise confidence sets. Our approach exploits the fact that the problem of sorting units into groups can be characterized by a large number of moment inequalities. Building on recent work by Chernozhukov, Chetverikov and Kato (2014), we develop procedures for testing the group membership of all units simultaneously. The confidence sets are derived by inverting this test. We use analytical critical values obtained from the theory of self-normalized sums as well as bootstrap critical values. The theoretical justification of our methods is based on large N, T asymptotics, where T can be very small compared to N. For both analytical and bootstrap critical values, we suggest a finite sample adjustment that is motivated by the finite sample behavior of the test statistic under normal errors. This adjustment gives confidence sets that have good coverage even for very small T and for non-normal errors. To illustrate their empirical relevance, we apply our methods to the classification of countries according to their respective paths towards democratization. The application illustrates that our procedures can yield an informative confidence set even if the panel is very short."

In this paper, we study the triangular model&nbsp;with random coefficients and exogenous regressors in both equations. We establish nonidentification of the joint distribution of the random coefficients, implying that counterfactual&nbsp;outcomes are also not identified. This result continues to hold, if we confine ourselves&nbsp;to the joint distribution of coefficients in the outcome equation or any marginal, except the&nbsp;one on the endogenous regressor. Identification continues to fail, even if we focus on means&nbsp;of random coefficients (implying that IV is generally biased), or let the instrument enter&nbsp;the first stage in a monotonic fashion. Based on this insight, we derive bounds on the joint&nbsp;distribution of random parameters, and suggest an additional restriction that allows to point&nbsp;identify the distribution of random coefficients in the outcome equation. We extend this&nbsp;framework to cover the case where the regressors and instruments have limited support, and&nbsp;analyze semi- and nonparametric sample counterpart estimators in finite and large samples.&nbsp;Finally, we provide an application of the framework to consumer demand."

This paper studies the design of competing standards in industries with positive network effects where the relevant network can be either industry-wide when standards are compatible (e.g., mobile phone standards) or standard-specific when standards are incompatible (e.g., video game consoles). In a three-stage model, standards choose how many patent holders to certify and patent holders then set royalties for using their own patents. I find that competing standards have incentives to soften the price competition among them through fragmenting their patent rights. Nevertheless, the degree of fragmentation is lessened when the competition among standards becomes more intense. Moreover, compatibility and network effects among standards also affect the incentives to fragment patent rights. These results provide alternative explanations to as why standards in many high-technology industries adopt highly fragmented patent rights structure. &nbsp;"

Reflecting these risks and benefits, multiple public and private organizations offer guidance to consumers on seafood consumption. The effect of this guidance is unknown; previous literature has been unable to disentangle the effects of messages with differing health information, provided by different sources, on demand for different types of seafood. The result is ambiguity regarding the drivers of observed changes in seafood demand. This study investigates the effect of health risk and benefit information on preferences for wild and farmed salmon and swordfish, three species targeted by consumer guidance. The analysis applies an experimental auction with seafood consumers informed by a Bayesian risk-learning model. The model provides a systematic means to disentangle effects on seafood demand, for example evaluating whether changes in demand for different species are due to information content or source. Using this approach, we test the effect of guidance provided by four different public and private groups in the US. Difference-in-difference tests find no impact of health benefit information regardless of source or message, but find multiple effects of health risk information that vary across different types of guidance. These findings suggest that current guidance does not improve consumers&rsquo; ability to balance health risks and benefits, and identify potential avenues to improve the efficacy of this guidance."

This paper tries to explain the puzzle from the cluster-based trade credit point of view. Using firm-level Annual Survey of Industrial Production data for China over the period of 1999-2007, we find that not only total trade credit received by a cluster can significantly promote firms&rsquo; export within the cluster, but net trade credit received from external clusters also have a positive effect on export of these firms. Further results show that clustering trade credit has a significantly positive effect on private firms with no effect on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) or foreign invested enterprises (FIEs). Additionally, firms in clusters that exhibit higher level of trade credit are more likely to enter the export market. The mechanism identified is that clustering trade credit help alleviate firm&rsquo;s financial constraint thereby improving non-exporters&rsquo; likelihood to export and expanding export level of exporters. To address potential endogeneity concerns of trade credit, we apply changes in firm location as a quasi-natural experiment finding the results are robust. Placebo test shows that trade credit has no significant effect on processing exports. The results are consistent with the fact that private enterprises in China have achieved a rapid export growth despite having almost no access to formal financing since China&rsquo;s market-oriented reform compared to SOEs and FIEs.o:p/o:p/font/font/spanp class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 16pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly""span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt; mso-themecolor: text1""o:pfont size=""3"" face=""宋体""&nbsp;/font/o:p/span&nbsp;"

Using a method of sign restrictions, we find that delayed overshooting is primarily a phenomenon of the 1980s when the Fed was under the chairmanship of Paul Volcker. Related findings are as follows: Uncovered interest parity fails to hold during the Volcker era and tends to hold during the post-Volcker era; US monetary policy shocks have substantial impacts on exchange rate variations but misleadingly appear to have small impacts when monetary policy regimes are pooled. In brief, we confirm Dornbusch&rsquo;s overshooting hypothesis."

We measure the distance from a model to a data generating process by Kullback-Leibler Information Criterion, and test the null hypothesis that two models are equally close to the data generating process. We make no assumption on the model specification of the truth, and allow for the cases where both, either or neither of the two competing models is mis-specified. As a prerequisite of the test, we first show that the quasi-maximum likelihood estimators (QMLE) of possibly mis-specified spatial models are consistent estimators of their pseudo-true values, and are asymptotically normal under regularity conditions. In particular, we study spatial autoregressive models with spatial autoregressive errors (SARAR) and matrix exponential spatial specification (MESS) models. We then construct a Vuong's style model selection test for essential non-nested competing models with spatially dependent data. A spatial heteroskedastic and autoregressive consistent estimator of asymptotic variance of the test statistic, which is necessary to implement the test, is constructed. Monte Carlo experiments are designed to investigate finite sample performance of QMLEs for SARAR and MESS models, as well as empirical sizes and powers of the proposed test./span/span/spanspan lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;""o:p/o:p/span"

Our research is motivated by the positive prospects of dominant assurance contract (Tabarrok, 1998) to address the increasing popularity of using voluntary contribution mechanism to fund public projects. We modify the existing assurance contract format by including a minimum price (MP) and an assurance payment (AP); a player will receive a compensation AP if she is willing to contribute above MP in case of provision failure.Theoretically, we find assurance payment significantly eliminates non-provision equilibria, and reduces the multiplicity of provision equilibria suffered by most discrete public good provision games. Experimentally, we examine a set of assurance payment schemes for both one unit using provision point mechanism (PPM) and multi-unit public good provision using individualized price auction (IPA). The assurance payment significantly increases provision point rate, both in the one-unit and the multiple-unit setting. Our proposed mechanism could be useful in establishing markets for a previously non-marketable good, and thus improve the efficiency regarding the provision of various types of public good currently funded only by government or through traditional non-profit donations."

We not only examine the short-run linkages between city size and wage dispersion, but also assess their long-run relationship to investigate whether the effects have temporal variation. Furthermore, we explore whether the effects of city size on wage dispersion differ between coastal and inland regions to assess development&rsquo;s role in forging agglomeration links. In addition, we assess this relationship for different public and private ownership structures within these two regions followed by an investigation of whether it is high-wage or low-wage workers that benefit from agglomeration. Given potential endogeneity of city size, we employ an instrumental variable regression (IV) approach.We find strong evidence that agglomeration has positive effects on wage dispersion in the short run and negative effects in the long run. The link between agglomeration and wage dispersion is much stronger in the inland region than in the coastal region and the differing coastal/interior region results are not due to differing private/public ownership distributions. Rather, these differences appear to be due to differing stages of development. We also find that positive short-term labor demand shocks tend to increase wages relatively uniformly in the upper-half of the distribution, while long-term agglomeration effects dampen average firm wages at the top and middle of the distribution and increase relative wages for firms at the bottom."

Residual momentum profits over long-term holding periods are insignificant but do not reverse, unlike traditional total return momentum strategies observed in the U.S. market. The findings in both short- and long-term holding periods are attributed to investor underreaction. The role of investor underreaction remains robust to the control of the confounding variables (such as institutional ownership, idiosyncratic volatilities, and firm age) that are known to lead investor limited attention."

In this paper, we estimate the effects of&nbsp;commodity price shocks on individual bank lending and bank risk, in a&nbsp;small commodity-exporting economy such as Canada. Bank risk is measured as&nbsp;the share of nonperforming loans and the ratio of noninterest income.&nbsp;Augmenting the framework of Charnavoki and Dolado (2014)with information&nbsp;from Canadian bank-level variables, we propose a structural dynamic factor&nbsp;model (henceforth, SDFM) that allows for dynamic interactions of the&nbsp;domestic&nbsp;economy and the banking sector, which are collectively subject to&nbsp;identied commodity price shocks. We&nbsp;find that only a commodity price&nbsp;shock driven by booming foreign economies has signicant favourable&nbsp;effects on Canadian bank lending and the share of nonperforming loans. In&nbsp;this circumstance, the commodity price shock strongly increases the ratio&nbsp;of noninterest income for the Big Six Canadian banks, while it reduces&nbsp;this ratio for other relatively smaller chartered banks so that the&nbsp;dispersion of noninterest income becomes wider across banks."

In this paper, we examine the effect of weather-induced mood on inventors&rsquo; productivity and the value implication of such an effect. We document that inventors exposed to more sunshine create patents with higher market valuation and forward citations. Our results hold after addressing alternative explanations and conducting exhaustive robustness tests. Furthermore, we show that inventors exposed to more sunshine engage in greater specialization than experimentation. Our paper is among the first to show that weather conditions have a real effect on firm value through the innovation channel."

A difference-in-differences analysis shows that relative to non-pilot stocks, pilot stocks saw a significantly larger increase in return synchronicity when the pilot program started, but such difference disappeared when Regulation SHO removed short-selling price tests for all stocks. The results suggest that high return synchronicity reflects high, rather than low, price informativeness./span"

We hypothesize that insiders strategically choose to be silent when they possess private information not yet reflected in stock prices. Consistent with our hypothesis, insider silence following a routine selling (buying) schedule predicts positive (negative) future abnormal returns as well as earnings surprise. The return predictability of insider silence is stronger among firms with worse information environment and facing higher arbitrage costs, suggesting that investors underweight the information conveyed in insider silence. We also find that insider silence forecasts future rm fundamentals (e.g., ROA, cash flows, analyst forecast revisions) and that sophisticated investors trade in the direction predicted by the information of insider silence. A long-short portfolio that exploits insiders' strategic silence behavior generates abnormal returns up to 10.4% annually."

Results based on Korean meat and fish products indicate that the proposed method is promising. Furthermore, prices of meat and fish are quantity inelastic while the prices of beef and pork are sensitive to changes in consumption scale."

We allow that both the factors and the disturbances are related to the outcome variable and other variables of interest. To make informative inference feasible, we impose that the contribution of the part of the confounding variables not captured by time specific effects, individual specific effects, or the common factors can be captured by a relatively small number of terms whose identities are unknown. Within this framework, we provide a convenient computational algorithm based on factor extraction followed by lasso regression for &nbsp;inference about parameters of interest and show that the resulting procedure has good asymptotic properties. We also provide a simple k-step bootstrap procedure that may be used to construct inferential statements about parameters of interest and prove its asymptotic validity. The proposed bootstrap may be of substantive independent interest outside of the present context as the proposed bootstrap may readily be adapted to other contexts involving inference after lasso variable selection and the proof of its validity requires some new technical arguments. We also provide simulation evidence about performance of our procedure and illustrate its use in two empirical applications."

This transformation result brings analytic advantage in relevant scenarios. We then propose conditions under which the optimal solution to such a principal-agent problem exists."

Despite wide usage, many of these methods present both theoretical and practical issues that have not been adequately resolved, especially for methods that have no software counterparts yet. In particular, we will study more intensively nonlinear moment conditions that have been proposed by Ahn and Schmidt (1995) but has been largely ignored by theorists and practitioners for a very long time.&nbsp;We show that estimators based on these nonlinear moment conditions are able to distinguish among not-so-persistent panel data, highly persistent panel data, and panel data with unit roots under certain model setups. It turns out that the widely available methods (in terms of existing software) either are unable to distinguish very well these three cases or are able to do so but under additional assumptions that are not plausible in empirical research. Nonlinear moment conditions will lead to the use of numerical algorithms which raise theoretical and practical issues for implementation. Instead of ignoring these issues, we show how to address them directly in order to make the estimators relevant to practitioners who need guidance for implementation.&nbsp;/span/span"

We consider economic environments where the self-reporting behavior is determined by: 1) The payoff structure, i.e., benefits from misreporting and penalties; and 2) The detection rate, i.e., the probability of being caught for misreporting. Under regularity conditions, we achieve nonparametric identification of the detection rate function, and proposed a three-step procedure to consistently estimation it. A desirable feature of our methods is that they do not rely on the specification of the payoff structure. As an empirical illustration, we apply our methods to study financial fraudulent reporting in China."

The in-?ll asymptotic distribution is asymmetric and tri-modal and delivers good approximations&nbsp;to the ?nite sample distribution. To reduce the bias in the estimation of both the&nbsp;continuous time and the discrete time models, a simulation-based method based&nbsp;on the indirect estimation (IE) approach is proposed.

We study how the buyer adjusts the procurement scheme under the threat of quality manipulation.&nbsp;In addition to the classical trade-off between efficiency and information rent, deterrence of corruption&nbsp;by the inefficient firm plays a key role in the optimal mechanism design. We show that, instead of&nbsp;under-reporting, as would be observed under a second-best mechanism without corruption, the buyer&nbsp;may overstate her preference for quality. Moreover, the buyer may be better off because the efficient&nbsp;firm&rsquo;s rent is eroded by corruption. Comparing two popular procurement schemes, the dominance of&nbsp;scoring auctions over minimum quality auctions reported in the literature does not hold under quality&nbsp;manipulation."

This shared goal may lead to crowding out. In a new approach, this paper analyzes the interaction of assistance with two dimensions of insurance design: level of coverage and types of risks covered. In a society of risk averse vulnerable individuals and risk neutral assistance providers, Pareto improvements in welfare are achieved through incompleteness in the types of risks covered. The results imply that safety nets promote demand for and the emergence of incomplete insurance. These results have a wide application to insurance markets where safety nets are available, including health care, disaster aid and social welfare."

Using unique NYSE order-level data, we find that a larger relative tick size benefits High-Frequency Trading (HFT) firms that make markets on the NYSE: they leave orders in the book longer, trade more aggressively, and have higher profit margins. The effects of a larger relative tick size on the market are more complex. In a one-tick spread environment, a larger relative tick size results in greater depth and more volume; in a multi-tick environment, the opposite outcome prevails. The negative impact on depth and volume in the multi-tick environment is consistent with greater adverse selection coming from increased undercutting of limit orders by informed HFT market makers."

If some of the factors of the true model cannot be observed, standard methods yield biased estimates for the risk prices of observed factors due to omitted variable bias. Our approach marries principal component analysis with two-pass cross-sectional regressions to extract the priced latent factors from a large panel of testing assets, and use them to infer the risk price of the observable factors. In addition to correcting for omitted factors, the methodology accounts for potential measurement errors in the observed factor, and detects when such a factor is spurious or even useless. The methodology exploits the power of large cross-sections, and we therefore apply it to a large panel of equity portfolios to estimate risk prices for several workhorse linear models."

Our study is motivated by an interesting pattern observed in the past decade that in the initially more densely populated cities the urban land development was expanded more outwardly with a relatively low use intensity. We link this pattern with the career concerns of Chinese city leaders who pursue faster GDP growth and generate more fiscal revenues by expanding the city outwardly. We first develop a theoretical model to demonstrate how a city leader with career concerns chooses the spatial pattern of urban land development and derive several testable predications. First, city leaders with high career incentives are more likely to expand the city outward. The underlying mechanism that drives this is that by doing so the city leader can generate more land sale revenues for financing public infrastructure, which in turn enhances the economic performance and her career prospect. Secondly, the average use intensity of newly developed land is lower for city leaders with higher career incentive due to the existence of a mechanical trade-off between a city&rsquo;s upward and outward expansion.Then we test these theoretical predictions using a large dataset on residential land transactions from 2000 to 2012 which are matched with the personal characteristics of city leaders during the same time period. We find robust evidence consistent with the predictions of our model. Our study highlights the important role of city leaders in shaping the unique patterns of urban land development in China.&nbsp;"

In empirical economics, it is often of interest to estimate the effect of a binary policy treatment variable on a binary outcome variable where both may be driven by common observable and unobservable factors. A common approach is to assume a parametric model, such as a bivariate probit, together with the use of instrumental variables to achieve point identification. Partial identification analysis of such problems allows for less restrictive assumptions for the underlying data generating process (DGP) in empirical applications, and the estimated bounds offer more robust measures for policy impacts. This paper applies the partial analysis approach to a health economics application. We estimate the bounds for average treatment effect (ATE) of private health insurance status on dental service utilisation, using data from the Australian National Health Survey. Four sets of bounds from the literature under varying DGP assumptions and their 95% confidence regions are estimated. The resulted ATE confidence bounds are much wider than the confidence intervals using a conventional bivariate probit. We found that two of the bounds have reasonably narrow widths to be informative. We also estimate bounds for different sub-populations with varying widths. Performances of global parametric, local parametric, and smoothed and raw non-parametric estimators for bounds are studied using generated data."

Unfortunately, many areas and high-risk groups lack sufficient data for deriving stable and reliable results. One solution is to borrow information from other areas and groups within the same country. However, directly assuming hierarchical structures within the HIV dynamic models is complicated and computationally time consuming. In this talk, we propose a simple and innovative way to incorporate the hierarchical information into the dynamic systems. The proposed method efficiently uses information from multiple areas and risk groups within each country without increasing the computational burden. As a result, the new model improves predictive ability in general with especially significant improvement in areas and risk groups with sparse data./span"

We propose a nonparametric structural model whose volatility is a function of the distance to default. We develop closed form formulas which relate RNDP and equity value to this asset volatility function and to asset price. We also show how to explicitly determine the implied RNDP and the implied asset value from the market price of the equity and from the market prices of calls written on the equity. Remarkably, the RNDP formula is independent of both the initial asset level and the debt level. Generalizations to incorporate interest rates, dividend yield, CEV, stochastic volatility into the model will also be discusses. This is based on the joint work with Peter Carr (NYU &amp; Morgan Stanley)."

Exploiting unique survey data that were collected in early 2013 (13 months before the outbreak of the conflict) and early 2015 (11 months after the outbreak), we employ two strategies to infer how the war has affected two different groups defined by distance to the war zone. First, we apply a before-after analysis to examine intra-group changes in attitudes over time. Second, we use a difference-in-difference approach to investigate inter-group divergence over time. Under particular assumptions, the latter approach yields a lower absolute bound for the effect. We control for a range of observed characteristics and consider both parametric and semiparametric estimation based on inverse probability weighting. Our results suggest that one year of conflict negatively affected attitudes towards Russia, while mostly no statistically signifficant intra- or inter-group differences were found for sentiments towards Ukraine."

The standard difference-in-difference approach measures only direct effects, assuming the control group is unaffected. We examine the 2007 SEC repeal of the uptick rule and find that the indirect effects are substantial. Unlike the 2005 partial repeal, total repeal enables aggressive portfolio shorting. Short sellers become much more aggressive across the board, and shorting activity increases, even in control stocks where the uptick rule was already suspended. We conclude that regulatory pilot designers should carefully consider potential spillovers."

The existing asympotic theory for this estimator does not cover situations in which the number of impulse response parameters exceeds the number of VAR model parameters. Situations in which this order condition is violated arise routinely in applied work. We establish the consistency of the impulse response matching estimator in this situation, we derive its asymptotic distribution, and we show how this distribution can be approximated&nbsp;by bootstrap methods. Our analysis sheds new light on the choice of the weighting matrix and covers both weakly and strongly identified DSGE model parameters. We also show that under our assumptions special care is needed to ensure the asymptotic validity of Bayesian methods of inference. A simulation study suggests that the interval estimators we propose are reasonably accurate in practice. We also show that using these methods may affect the substantive conclusions in empirical work.&nbsp;"

Within 500 kilometers of the three major seaports in China, closure of zones reduced firm-level TFP by 9.62%, whereas closure of zone farther away did not show significant effects.

Such a population structure is most accurately described by a finite mixture model. The evidence for mixture is best examined through a rigorous statistical hypothesis test. Developing valid and effective statistical inference methods is an important and challenging research problem. Classical procedures when applied to mixture models often have sophisticated asymptotic properties which render them useless in applications. For many finite mixture models, we have successfully designed corresponding EM-tests whose limiting distributions are easier to derive mathematically and simpler for implementation in data analysis.

An ideal of contributing to public goods divides players to different social categories: Players who identify with the ideal become insiders, obtaining identity utility but incurring disutility if their contributions depart from the ideal, while players who do not identify with the ideal remain as outsiders. To best resolve the free-riding problem of the public good game, the ideal level being chosen reflects a tradeoff between the depth and width of identity. With uniform distribution of players' preference, we solve for the optimal ideal that maximizes public good contribution, and show that this ideal also maximizes welfare as long as the population is large enough. We then extend our analysis to general distribution functions. Our analyses have implications for social policymaking, especially for policies that aim for greenhouse gas abatement, energy conservation, etc."

Using a unique dataset for the trading activities in the market of deep out-of-the-money S&amp;P 500 put options, we identify periods when the variations in the net amount of trading between financial intermediaries and public investors are likely to be mainly driven by shocks to intermediary constraints. We then infer tightness of intermediary constraints from the quantities of option trading during such periods. We show that a tightening of intermediary constraint according to our measure is associated with increasing option expensiveness, higher risk premia for a wide range of financial assets, deterioration in funding liquidity, and deleveraging of broker-dealers."

In this transition, the major challenge faced by financial institutions is the unavailability of simple tools for evaluation of ES forecasts (i.e. backtesting ES). The main purpose of this article is to propose such tools. We establish the asymptotic properties of the test, and investigate its finite sample performance through some Monte Carlo simulations. An empirical application to three major stock indexes shows that V aR is generally unresponsive to extreme events such as those experienced during the recent financial crisis, while ES provides a more accurate description of the risk involved.&nbsp;"

The correlation function of the approximating Gaussian is taken as the local Gaussian correlation at this location. It is a very useful nonlinear dependence measure. In the talk I will review some recent developments, including the local Gaussian autocorrelation and its use in measuring nonlinear serial dependence in time series.

Does alcohol consumption affect negotiator's strategy and consequently the outcome of the negotiation? If so, what is the mechanism through which alcohol impacts negotiator's behavior? We investigate the effect of a moderate amount of alcohol on negotiation using controlled experiments. Subjects are randomly matched into pairs to play a bargaining game with adverse selection. In the game, each subject is given a private endowment. The total endowment is scaled up and shared equally between the pair provided that they agree to collaborate. It is found that a moderate amount of alcohol consumption increases subjects' willingness to collaborate, thus improving their average payoff. We find that alcohol consumption increases neither subjects' preference for risk nor altruism. A possible explanation for the increase in the likelihood of collaboration is that subjects under the influence of alcohol are more &quot;cursed&quot; in the sense of Eyster and Rabin (2005), which is supported by the estimation results of a structural model of quantal response equilibrium.a href=""/Upload/File/2016/4/20160418102036458.pdf""stronguspan style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);""Paper/span/u/strong/a"

Decadal climate variability (DCV) is another force that has been found to influence crop yields and water supplies. DCV phenomena are in early stages of being explored. This thesis explores the regional impact analysis of increased drought frequency on water management, estimates the effects of DCV on crop yields in the Edwards Aquifer (EA) region of Texas, and appraises the regional value of DCV information. We find that increased drought frequency will cause a regional agricultural loss of $6.47 million per year with substantial land transferred to grazing. We also find that the average economic value of a perfect DCV forecast is $40.25 million per year."

They centred on situations in which economic information is asymmetrical or incomplete, determining how incompleteness should affect economic policies. One example is the theory of optimal income taxation. Another is the theory of insurance and contracts when there is &quot;moral hazard&quot;. Mirrlees and William Vickrey shared the 1996 Nobel Prize for Economics &quot;for their fundamental contributions to the economic theory of incentives under asymmetric information&quot;.&nbsp;Mirrlees is also co-creator of the Diamond-Mirrlees Efficiency Theorem, published in 1971.&nbsp;On retirement from Cambridge, Mirrlees became a part-time professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and also held visiting appointments at the University of Macau and the University of Melbourne.

We show that without financial frictions, anticipated inflation has the same marginal effect, no matter which of the three implementation scheme is used by the central bank (CB). However, with OMO alone, though extended periods of positive inflation is possible if the CB continually increases its bond purchases, positive steady state inflation is not feasible. When borrowers are constrained by financial frictions, there is a liquidity premium in bond prices and LST can have qualitatively different predictions regarding the relationship between inflation and welfare than SLF and OMO, because the latter two have differential effects on borrowers and lenders. OMO further differs from SLF in that it not only affects inflation and the loan market, but also changes the amount of government bonds that private agents can carry to insure against risks.&nbsp;"

We provide a new measurement on human performance using gamers' productivity in a popular computer-based online game. After exploiting cross-player and cross-day variations of temperature and game records, we find that low temperature leads to longer game time and lower gamer performance. Each degree decrease in temperature below 0 C degrees leads to 6.5 more minutes on gaming and 1.6% decrease in gamers' productivity on average. Temperature impacts show heterogeneity based on gamers' devotion ot the game and weekly pattern. Human adaptive behavior through heating decreases negative impacts of outdoor temperature significantly. We also find some evidences of negative impacts on gamers' productivity from high temperature above 21C degrees. Our results draws attention to potential damages of low temperature on human performance, especially in regions with limited access to heating while being exposed to extreme cold. &nbsp;"

Research on mobile sources of pollution has  foundered due both to inaccessibility of Chinese data on health outcomes and  strong identifying assumptions. To address these, we collect daily ambulance  call data from the Beijing Emergency Medical Center and combine them with an  idiosyncratic feature of a driving restriction policy in Beijing that references  the last digit of vehicles' license plate numbers. Because the number 4 is  considered unlucky by many in China, it tends to be avoided on license plates.  As a result, days on which the policy restricts license plates ending in 4  unintentionally allow more vehicles in Beijing. Leveraging this variation, I  find that traffic congestion is indeed 20% higher on days banning 4 and that  24-hour average concentration of NO2 is 12% higher. Correspondingly, these short  term increases in pollution increase ambulance calls by 12% and 3% for fever and  heart related symptoms, while no effects are found for injuries. These findings  suggest that traffic congestion has substantial health externalities in China  but that they are also responsive to policy./span&nbsp;"

We show that this previous finding can be overturned within an identical model which allows for sustained endogenous growth. Specifically, progressive taxation may operate like an automatic destabilizer that leads to equilibrium indeterminacy and sunspot-driven cyclical fluctuations in an endogenously growing macroeconomy. This instability result is obtained under two tractable progressive tax policy formulations that have been considered in the existing literature."

Rabin and Thaler (2001) showed that EUT of wealth is not a satisfactory explanation of risk aversion. We use empirical data from a controlled laboratory experiment to show that EUT of income does not explain risk aversion either and loss aversion is a more convincing explanation. More importantly, we demonstrate that an empirical model with loss aversion and rank-dependent probability weighting can best fit the experimental data. Lacking knowledge on reference points is the usual obstacle in explaining risk averse behavior with loss aversion. When certainty equivalents are directly elicited, it is often unclear what the decision maker's reference point is. We instead elicit valuations-Willingness to Pay (WTP) and Willingness to Accept (WTA) -for risky prospects. This experimental design combined with an empirical model based on Koszegi and Rabin (2006) is robust/insensitive to changes in reference points. Our empirical model features a single loss aversion parameter and a non-parametric probability weighting function and also takes EUT as its special case. Through a structural estimation, we show that both loss aversion and probability weighting are needed to explain risk aversion. The obtained estimates are consistent with literature."

We address three key challenges: omitted variable bias, measurement error bias, and reverse causality. To control for omitted genetic factors and family background, we use a within-monozygotic-twin-pair fixed-effects model. The instrumental variable fixed-effects method is used to correct measurement error bias. Finally we employ industry average income as an instrumental variable and suggest that the causality runs from income to happiness. The results are robust after we address concerns about potential biases of within-monozygotic-twin-pair estimates, use various measures of income and wealth, and consider the potential cross effect of twin sibling&rsquo;s income. This paper adds to the literature on the causal effect of income on happiness, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the first suchstudy which draws on twins data to correct both omitted variable bias and measurement error bias."

Rather than automatically close insolvent systemically important financial institutions (SIFI), the FDIC revived them by infusing funds into them. Ronn and Verma (1986) call the tolerance level below which a bank closure is triggered the regulatory policy parameter. We derive a model in which we make this policy parameter stochastic and bank-specific to infer the stock market view of the regulatory capital forbearance value. Our two-factor model, in which the regulatory policy parameter is modeled as an exponential of a negative Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process, yields a closed-form solution for banks&rsquo; equity. For over 565 U.S. listed banks from 1990 to 2012, we link the model-derived forbearance fraction in equity capital to bank specific risk variables and business cycles. This forbearance fraction in capital represents 17%, on average, of the market valuation of bank equity and can go as high as 100%. We find that the market, naturally, expects banks to receive more capital forbearance in recessions. The market expectations of bank regulatory forbearance are also congruent with banks&rsquo; intrinsic owner-contributed capital, idiosyncratic risk, systemic risk, and charter value."

It emphasizes the direct use of preference orderings (e.g. revealed preference), which are potentially powerful in terms of dealing with unobserved heterogeneity in high-dimensions (Kitmaura and Stoye, 2013). We explore the approach based on preference orderings in details, though we also contrast it with other recently proposed nonparametric methods which often rely on smoothing techniques. The nonparametric methods discussed in the course require computation in high dimensions, and therefore we investigate their algorithmic aspects as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;As recognized in the recent literature, accounting for unobserved heterogeneity is tremendously important for applied microeconometric analysis (Compiani and Kitamura, 2015). In particular, it is highly desirable and often crucial to incorporate infinite dimensional heterogeneity in empirical research. This makes some of conventional nonparametric methods, which often demand monotonicity type restrictions and smoothness assumptions, difficult to apply. We pursue an alternative framework based on preference orderings. It enables us to avoid reliance of smoothness assumptions and other ad hoc restrictions on functional properties: it instead utilizes geometric properties (see, for example, Ziegler, 1995, Gruber, 2007 and Grunbaum, 2003 for geometric background) provided by economic theory. Another benefit is that implementing this approach typically requires only linear/quadratic programming, which can be carried out even in extremely high dimensions, and recent progress in computational methods can be used to execute them. Our approach is quite general and avoids arbitrary restrictions, and consequently we typically need to deal with partially identified objects. To that end, we briefly review basics of modern methods in partially identified models and moment inequalities."

The further disaggregated decomposition analysis in the industry sector shows that energy intensity improvements were widely achieved in 36 sub-industries in PRD. As economic growth and urbanization continue, reductions in energy intensity and clean energy therefore deserve much more policy attentions due to their crucial roles in carbon reduction as well as satisfying the energy demand.&nbsp;"

In this paper, we analyze the effect of first stage estimation error on the estimation of copula parameters, which is important for statistical inference. In particular, for semiparametric / non-parametric GARCH filtered residuals, we address three questions (1)Will the asymptotic distribution of the two-step copula parameter estimator be affected by the first stage estimation error ? (2) How will the estimation of the dynamic GARCH parameters affect the sieve MLE of copula parameters? (3) Will the sieve MLE of copula parameters be more efficient than the two-step copula parameter estimator? Simulation studies are provided to examine the asymptotic properties and the finite sample performances of various estimators."

Variations in fines across provinces on unauthorized births under the one-child policy and in cohort-specific fertility influenced by the implementation of population control policies are exploited to facilitate identification. We find evidence that older households with a reduced number of adult children save more because of old-age security concerns, middle-aged households experience an increase in saving due to the lighter burden of dependent children, and younger households save more because of having fewer siblings to share the responsibility of parental care. These findings lend support to a simple economic model in which the effects of population control policies are investigated in the context of household saving decisions in China."

Researchers often include many covariates to control for observed and unobserved confounders. Often the number of covariates may be an important fraction of the sample size. We consider corresponding asymptotics where the number of covariates grows as fast as sample size. We show asymptotic normality and give consistent standard errors. With homoscedasticity we find that the usual standard errors with a degrees of freedom correction are correct. We also give new heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors, and show that the usual Eicker-White standard errors are inconsistent. These results add to regression theory where previous asymptotic normality results restricted the number of regressors to grow slower than the sample size."

Most literature assumes that all the input variables are quantitative. However, researchers often encounter computer experiments involving both qualitative and quantitative variables (BQQV). In this talk, a new interface on design and analysis for computer experiments with BQQV is proposed. The new designs are one kind of sliced Latin hypercube design with points clustered in the design region, and possess good uniformity for each slice. For computer experiments with BQQV, such designs help to measure the similarities among responses of different level-combinations in the qualitative variables. An adaptive analysis strategy intended for the proposed designs is developed. The proposed strategy allows us to automatically extract information from useful auxiliary responses to increase the precision of prediction for the target response. The interface between the proposed design and the analysis strategy is demonstrated to be effective via simulation and a real-life example from the food engineering literature.&nbsp;/span/span/span"

In this political and economic institution central government creates yardstick competition on economic growth among local governments through their absolute personnel control. Yet, the direct empirical evidence on that mechanism is rather limited. This paper focuses on a unique reform in China&rsquo;s goverance structure, which circumvents prefectures and allows counties to interact directly with their corresponding provinces in fiscal disciplines, namely the Province Directly Governing County fiscal reform.In this way, this reform intensifies the aforementioned yardstick competition. Using a difference-in-differences propensity score matching strategyand a large fiscal dataset at the county level from 2000 to 2007, we identify the causal impacts of the reform on the most commonly used fiscal tools by local governments&mdash;their expenditure policy. Our results show that the reform increases government spending and leads to a fund allocation with a larger weight on capital construction and smaller weights on education.&nbsp;"

Its predictive power is also stronger than and is complimentary to the popular investor sentiment indexes. Moreover, manager sentiment also negatively predicts future aggregate earnings and cross-sectional stock returns, particularly for those firms that are either hard to value or difficult to arbitrage.a target=""_blank"" href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2662288"" style=""color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/wbr/wbrpapers.cfm?abstract_id=2662288/a&nbsp;"

Efficient dimension reduction techniques are essential for analyzing such data. &nbsp;Principal component analysis (PCA) is a ubiquitous technique for dimension reduction of classical multivariate data. Regularization of PCA becomes necessary for high dimensionality, for example, in techniques such as functional PCA and sparse PCA. I shall introduce a general framework that enables flexible regularization of PCA, and leads to alternative approaches for its regularized siblings. I will illustrate its applicability using business analytics applications, including workforce management of labor-intensive service systems and yield curve forecasting. If time permits, I shall conclude with a general asymptotic framework for studying consistency properties of PCA.

We show that U.S. QE policy plays a significant role in affecting Chinese exporters&rsquo; exchange rate pass-through due to various exporting destinations with distinct responses of exchange rate. First, this paper develops a theoretical model linking QE monetary policy and Chinese exporters through exchange rate pass-through. Our model predicts that the firms with different destination have various responses of US QE policies. Second, we test and quantify the theoretical mechanisms using Chinese firm-product-level data with information on exports by destination and U.S. quantitative easing policy index. We confirm that exchange rate reaction to U.S. quantitative easing policy and market share are key determinants of pass-through among Chinese exp. An exporter with no quantitative easing influence has a nearly complete pass-through, while a firm at the 95supth/sup percentile of both quantitative easing influence and market share has a pass-through of just 83.10%. The pass-through to the export destination with currency appreciation and exporters with high-market-share is lower, which helps explain the heterogeneity of U.S. quantitative easing influences on exchange rate pass-through of Chinese exporters./span/span/span"

This improves power against relevant local alternatives. To show the validity of our approach we draw on recent results on the directional differentiability of the least concave majorant operator, and on bootstrap inference when smoothness conditions sufficient to apply the functional delta method for the bootstrap are not satisfied."

We find that higher program exposure, measured by percentage of villages implemented the JGY program in a district, leads to higher probability of receiving child vaccination and antenatal checkup. An examination of underlying mechanisms indicates that electrification upgradation program increases medical goods consumption by improving operation efficiency at local primary health care facilities and improving access to health related information."

In view of the complex nature of modern insurance products, research on modeling dependent classes of business has become an important topic in the actuarial literature. This talk discusses the so-called risk model with thinning dependence proposed by Wang and Yuen (2005) [Insurance:Mathematics and Economics, 36(3), 456-468]. A special case of this model is the frequently-used common shock risk model. Based on the thinning dependence, a few major actuarial issues including ruin analysis, optimal dividend and optimal reinsurance are considered."

With time-varying operators, the AFAR model can be safely used in both stationary and non-stationary situations. A closed-form maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is derived under stationarity. The result is further extended for non-stationarity, where the time-dependent operators are adaptively estimated under local homogeneity. We provide the theoretical results of the ML estimator and the adaptive estimator. Simulation study illustrates nice finite sample performance of the AFAR modeling. The AFAR model also exhibits a superior accuracy in the forecast exercise of the California electricity daily price curves compared to several alternatives."

Based on the large scale of user logs from a wallpaper mobile app, we find two interesting observations, named iAttention Valley/i and iStimulus Mountain/i.

Housing price uncertainty can affect household property investments, which in turn affect rent. By extending the theory of investment under uncertainty, we model the renter&rsquo;s decision to buy a house and the landlord&rsquo;s decision to sell as the exercising of real options of waiting and examine real options effects on rent. Using data from Hong Kong and mainland China, we find a significant causal effect of housing price on rent and draw important policy implications."

Building on the same framework, we provide a new polynomial representation of the liquidity discount. We also simplify the Chen model to a closedform solution in a situation where there is no trading in the market place. We demonstrate in analytical forms that convexity in a security payoff is absolutely positively related to liquidity discounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we contribute to the literature in relating the Chen model to trading volume (e.g. Karpoff (1986, 1987)). Using the price and trading volume data of the 9 largest financialbr /firms in the U.S., we find strong support of the Chen model."

A disaggregated analysis identifies a common stochastic trend for several though fewer than half of country pairs within a union, particularly compared to the set of country pairs not in unions. Some unions such as the Eurozone have small shares of cointegrated country pairs. These results provide an alternative metric to intra-union trade for gauging the extent of currency union integration."

While inference for the linear Gaussian model is fairly simple, inference for nonlinear models can be difficult and often relies on derivative free numerical optimization techniques. &nbsp;A promising method that I will discuss is based on particle approximations of the conditional distribution of the hidden process given the data. This distribution is needed for both classical inference (e.g., Monte Carlo EM type algorithms) and Bayesian inference (e.g., Gibbs sampler). &nbsp;&nbsp;Particle methods are an extension of sequential importance sampling (SIS). Although the SIS algorithm has been known since the early 1970s, its use in nonlinear problems remained largely unnoticed until the early 1990s. Obviously the available computational power was too limited to allow convincing applications of these methods, but other difficulties plagued the technique. Time series data are typically long and particles have a tendency to die young. &nbsp;Consequently, the approach is cursed by dimensionality. But as Shakespeare noted, if dimensionality curseth, a better algorithm useth.&nbsp;"

The classic measures focus on linear conditional correlations, and are incapable of characterizing non-linear conditional relationship including non-monotonic relationship. To overcome this limitation, we introduces a nonparametric measure of conditional dependence for multivariate random variables with arbitrary dimensions. Our measure possesses the necessary and intuitive properties as a correlation index. Briefly, it is zero almost surely if and only if two multivariate random variables are conditionally independent given a third random variable. More importantly, the sample version of this measure can be expressed elegantly as the root of a V or U-process with random kernels and has desirable theoretical properties. Based on the sample version, we propose a test for conditional independence, which is proven to be more powerful than some recently developed tests through our numerical simulations. The advantage of our test is even greater when the relationship between the multivariate random variables given the third random variable cannot be expressed in a linear or monotonic function of one random variable versus the other. We also show that the sample measure is consistent and weakly convergent, and the test statistic is asymptotically normal. By applying our test in a real data analysis, we are able to identify two conditionally associated gene expressions, which otherwise cannot be revealed. Thus, our measure of conditional dependence is not only an ideal concept, but also has important practical utility. This is a joint work with Wenliang Pan, Wenhao Hu, Yuan Tian and Heping Zhang."

It finds much lower rates of mobility in all eras than previous studies have suggested, though there is some increase in mobility in the Republican and Communist eras. The authors argue it more likely reflects mainly a systematic tendency of conventional mobility studies to overestimate rates of social mobility of status, where status is partially measured by income, wealth and education at individual or household level.Taiping rebellion as a migration cultural shock: The failure of public primary schooling in the Lower Yangzi of the Republican Era (1900-1949)br /This paper, using DID methods, explores the differential impact of the Taiping rebellion (1851-1864) and consequent mass migration on the provision of new public schooling in the early 20th century lower Yangzi region of China.  It finds that places were less successful in financing primary public or semi-public schooling if they experienced a greater migration cultural shock by immigrants, defined as the difference between surname distribution of the native population before the rebellion and that of the population after the rebellion. This result is robust to controlling for the compositional effect of immigrants who entails different level of human capital, and other socio-economic and geographic factors. Besides, if finds that the differential effect of diversity shock faded away after 1920s, indicating either migrants had blended in or the provincial and state governments made transfers of funds to the places with greater adverse shock."

We estimate the effects of three treatments &mdash;prior impulse controlling activity, consumption of a sugared drink, and consumption of a sugar-free drink&mdash; on intertemporal financial decisions. Contrary to those models, prior exertion of impulse control increases financial patience. Sugared drink consumption also increases patience, but so does sugar-free drink consumption, raising doubts about blood glucose as a key willpower resource. To better understand these results, we estimate treatment effects on three structurally-estimated utility parameters for each subject. All three treatments have robust effects on utility curvature, and smaller effects on present-bias. These two parameters move together, though they are largely unaffected by the treatments among subjects with very high cognitive ability. We argue that these patterns are more consistent with a scenario where the treatments reduced subjects&rsquo; adherence to an income-as-consumption heuristic rather than affecting their willpower."

The presence of these local banks though designed by policymakers to promote local growth by lending to SMEs, had the problem of being influenced heavily by the local governments. This paper develops a model in which firms can bribe local government to obtain credits from these banks, where large firms can offer large bribes due to its size. Credits would instead be channeled to large firms. This firm size distribution change would contrarily lower city's economic growth. Using 2001-2010 panel data for all the cities in China, we find that the establishment of CCB significantly reduced local city's economic growth. Using data on 206,771 firms during 1999-2007, we find that CCB significantly reduced firm's growth rate in that city, small firms in particular, while the effect turned positive for large firms. The firm size distribution change provides a channel for city's reduced growth rate."

A reference-dependent intertemporal utility model is proposed on top of the discounted utility model by incorporating an additional gain-loss utility at each time point. The reference-dependent model would predict when people take future-oriented outcome sequence as a reference point, they appear to be more patient, and when people take present-oriented outcome sequence as a reference point, they appear to be more impatient. We conduct an experiment to test these theoretical predictions. In the experiment, we adopt price list design in which one option is fixed on one side of the list, the other options get better from top to bottom on the other side of the list. Our results confirm that subjects see the fixed option in the list as a reference point. And their choice behaviours are consistent with the predictions of the model. We conduct structural estimation of the choice data for the reference-dependent model. The estimated loss aversion parameter is significantly larger than one, suggesting that loss looms larger than gain in the intertemporal setting. We further discuss the implication of observed reference-dependent effect of price list design on recent debates regarding the elicitation of time preference."

Professors value enrollment, learning, and student study time and set their policies taking into the account the policies of the other professors. Students respond to grading policies in their selection of courses and how much to study conditional on enrolling. Men and women are allowed to have different preferences over course types, the benefits associated with higher grades, and the cost of exerting more effort. Two decompositions are performed. First, we separate out how much of the differences in grading policies across fields is driven by differences in demand for courses in those fields and how much is due to differences in professor preferences across fields. Second, we separate out differences in female/male course taking across fields is driven by i) differences in cognitive skills, ii) differences in the valuation of grades, iii) differences in the cost of studying, and iv) differences in field preferences. We then use the structural parameters to evaluate restrictions on grading policies. Restrictions on grading policies that equalize grade distributions across classes result in higher (lower) grades in science (nonscience) fields but more (less) work being required. As women value grades more than men and find studying less costly, this restriction on grading policies results in more women pursuing the sciences and more men pursuing the nonsciences."

Our analysis includes long-term weather trends and water supply conditions as well as seasonal water supply forecasts. A farm-level panel data set, which accounts for the priority effects of water rights and controls for diversified crop mixes and rotation practices, is used. Our results indicate that farmers respond to long-term surface and ground water conditions as well as to the seasonal water supply variation. Climate change-induced variations in weather and water supply conditions could lead to substantial damages to irrigated agriculture. We project substantial losses (up to 32%) of the average crop revenue for major agricultural areas under future climate scenarios in Idaho. Finally, farmers demonstrate significantly varied responses given their water rights priorities, which implies that the distributional impact of climate change is sensitive to institutions such as the Prior Appropriation Doctrine."

Starting with motivations of these models, I discuss some fundamental issues, i.e. ergodicity and parameter estimation. A negative binomial integer-valued GARCH model is considered in details, real data analysis shows its superior performance compared with other models."

The treatment letters were addressed to a nationally renowned charitable organization in China, while the control letters were intended to an invented individual. A total of 832 ready-to-be-posted letters were dropped in 208 communities across eight districts in the city. The overall return rate was only about 13%. Yet, the return rate of the treatment letters (17%) was nearly twice as high as that of the control letters (9%). The results suggest that in contrast to the invented individual, the altruistic attributes of the charitable organization strengthened the altruistic preferences of the passerby and accordingly induced more of their altruistic acts. The finding is consistent with the prediction of the interdependent other-regarding preferences models. We also found that the letters were more likely to be returned if they were dropped in communities with a relatively higher income or a postal box located closer."

The uniform price auction mechanism (UPA) collects an endogenously determined uniform price from everyone offering at least that price, while the uniform price cap mechanism (UPC) collects the uniform price from everyone offering at least that price, plus the full offer of everyone offering less. By rebating full amounts in excess of the price, the uniform price mechanisms create regions where the expected increase in payment associated with a higher offer is zero. We show that the uniform price mechanisms support Bayesian Nash equilibria (BNE) with higher contributions than BNE of PPM or PR, potentially increasing efficiency. We use laboratory experiments to test whether these more efficient BNE obtain, leading to higher contributions or more frequent provision. Our mechanisms outperform PR and PPM with private values: UPC generates higher aggregate contributions and provision rates than PR and PPM; UPA attracts much higher contributions, although it provides less frequently. This ranking emerges because high offers are more common (especially among high-value people) in the uniform price mechanisms, where it is low cost to venture high offers to potentially meet other high offers to support provision."

We invited 300 job seekers to search for jobs in our computer facilities at the University of Edinburgh for 12 consecutive weekly sessions. They searched for real jobs using our web interface. After 3 weeks, we introduced a manipulation of the interface for half of the sample. The manipulation consisted of providing suggestions of alternative occupations to consider, based on the profile of the job seeker. These suggestions were made using background information from readily available labour market transitions data. We find that such an intervention affects job search behaviour. For job seekers who are searching relatively narrowly, the intervention broadens their search and significantly improves their job interviews. This applies especially to those with several months of unemployment duration."

Research on extracurricular and leisure activities documents sizeable positive associations between the engagement in structured activities and measures of skills, educational attainment and labor market outcomes. What are the underlying mechanisms? This paper first develops a simple model to clarify the potential links between leisure time use and human capital formation. Then we explore empirically what youths do in their leisure. We further focus on sports as a popular activity and estimate its effect on a set of behavioral and economic outcomes. The empirical analysis exploits data from the German Socio-Economic Panel that offers the unique advantage of both a large, representative sample and high quality behavioral measures. We employ a flexible strategy combining propensity score matching and regression techniques to account for self selection into athletic involvement. We assess the plausibility of no-unmeasured confounding using human capital measures that are predetermined with respect to athletic involvement. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that structured leisure activities like sports contribute to the development of nonacademic skills."

Her current research questions include attitudes towards immigrants and social determinants of successful child outcomes, including the size and nature of peer effects in the neighbourhood, classroom and prisons and the effects of youth mentoring programs for socially disadvantaged children.&nbsp;She joined the IZA research network in August 2014.Prof. Anna Piil Damm' homepage",Prison as a Criminal School: Who Learns and From Whom?

First, we provide descriptive evidence that young first-time incarcerated adults tend to recidivate with crimes in crime category h in which they have prior experience. Therefore, our empirical model for estimating the effects of exposure to inmates with previous conviction of type h crime (the peer effect) on recidivism with crime category h 12, 24 and 36 months after release allows the peer effect to vary w.r.t. whether the individual has a previous conviction within crime category h. We refer to a positive effect on exposure to inmates with past experience with crime category h on recidivism within crime category h i) conditional on having past experience with type h crime as a reinforcing peer effect and ii) conditional on having no past experience with type h crime as an introductory peer effect. Relying only on within-prison-within-crime-type-h variation, for h equal to drug-related crimes, threats, theft, burglary and fencing as well as vandalism and arson, we find evidence of a reinforcing peer effect on recidivism/number of convictions of type h crime after release. By contrast, for violence and sexual offenses, robbery and offenses against the Weapons Act we find no evidence of a reinforcing peer effect on recidivism/number of convictions of type h crime after release. Moreover, we find no evidence of introductory peer effects. Therefore, policies that assign young first-time incarcerated offenders with past experience with drug-related crimes, threats, theft, burglary and fencing or vandalism and arson, to prisons with high shares of criminals who are experienced criminals in the same field as individual i may lead to perverse effects on recidivism with drug-related crimes, threats, theft, burglary and fencing or vandalism and arson.&nbsp;Note: The &ldquo;WISE-IZA&rdquo; seminar series is transmitted from IZA in Bonn using e-conference technology."

Pure bundling is superior because it intensifiesthe competition between firms by reducing their cost asymmetry. Mixedbundling is inferior because it allows firms to coordinate to the highprices associated with separate purchase. (Pure) bundling is more likely tobe selected as a procurement strategy when: (i) the products' values arehigher relative to their possible costs, (ii) costs for different goods aremore negatively or less positively dependent, or (iii) the cost distributionof each product is more dispersed."

We allow the number ofclasses to be relatively large. As a result, the total number of relevant features islarger than usual. This makes the related classification problem much morechallenging than the conventional one, where the number of classes is small (veryoften two). To solve the problem, we propose a novel pairwise sure independencescreening method for linear discriminant analysis with an ultrahigh dimensionalpredictor. The proposed procedure is directly applicable to the situation with manyclasses. We further prove that the proposed method is screening consistent.Simulation studies are conducted to assess the finite sample performance of the newprocedure. We also demonstrate the proposed methodology via an empirical analysisof a real life example on handwritten Chinese character recognition.&nbsp;Keywords: Multi-class Linear Discriminant Analysis; Pairwise Sure IndependenceScreening; Sure Independence Screening; Strong Screening Consistency."

Second,possible friendship selection bias on network interactions can be corrected as the networkformation is explicitly modeled. The proposed model is estimated by the Bayesian method.In the empirical study, we apply the model to American high school students' friendshipnetworks in the Add Health dataset. From two activity variables which are considered in thepaper -- GPA and smoking frequency, we find a significant incentive effect from GPA, but notfrom smoking, on friendship formation. These results suggest that the benefit of interactionsin academic learning is an important factor for forming friendships, while the pleasure ofsmoking together is not. However, from the perspective of network interactions, both GPAand smoking frequency are subject to significant positive interaction (peer) effects.&nbsp;a href=""/EventsMgr/Upload/File/2015/4/20150415040724475.pdf""Download the paper/a"

Exploiting the longitudinal structure of the NLSY79 and random fluctuations in weather across interviews, we identify the effect of temperature in models with child-specific fixed effects. We find that short-run changes in temperature lead to statistically significant decreases in cognitive performance on math (but not reading) beyond 26C (78.8F). In contrast, our long-run analysis, which relies upon long-difference and rich cross-sectional models, find no statistically significant relationship between climate and human capital. This finding is consistent with the notion that adaptation, particularly compensatory behavior, plays a significant role in limiting the long run impacts from short run weather shocks.&nbsp;a href=""http://www.iza.org/en/papers/1635_14042015.pdf""Download the paper/a"

A public good provision mechanism, proposed by the government (or, the principal), isa mapping from agents&rsquo; reported valuations to the decisions of whether to provide the publicgood and also how to allocate the cost of the public good among agents should the publicgood be provided. A key assumption of our model is that the principal faces a constitutionalconstraint in the sense that in order for a mechanism to be implemented, the mechanismmust first be approved by agents under a prespecified voting rule. We find that as long as thevoting rule is not the unanimity rule, then the principal can design a mechanism such thatfirst-best efficiency of the provision of the public good is always achieved. We also considervarious constraints which may prevent our mechanism from proper functioning (such as theprohibition of the use of discriminatory mechanisms, or the existence of interest groups andvote buying). We discuss the optimal voting rule in such situations.Keywords: Public goods; Voting; Efficiency.JEL classification: D82, H41, D72"

They drive individuals to lose sight of long-term goals, such as leading a sustainable and healthy life, and promote overindulgence and waste. We show that providing real-time feedback on a specific resourceintense behavior can be a powerful remedy for this bias: In a large-scale field experiment, participants receive real-time feedback on their resource use. We find that this approach reduced resource consumption by 22% - much larger conservation gains than conventional policy interventions achieve. Real-time feedback directly overcomes salience bias, and avoids the negative psychological pressure that has been observed with widely-used policy interventions. Providing real-time feedback has the potential for cost-effective policy interventions aimed at resource conservation, and could help individuals eliminate salience bias in other domains of life.span style="" font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;""Note: The &ldquo;WISE-IZA&rdquo; seminar series is transmitted from IZA in Bonn using e-conference technology./span"

Specifically, dealers with large capacity comprise the core of the network, connecting them to&nbsp;all other dealers, while dealers who have small capacity operate at the periphery.

More importantly, I show that&nbsp;there may be structural breaks in this negative relationship as variations in order sizes may alter the inter-dealer&nbsp;network.

Focusing on the AFDC and TANF programs, which have been most studied on this issue, we first emphasize that the literature, by and large, has assumed that the rules of those programs make a key distinction between married women and cohabiting women, but this is not a correct interpretation. In fact, it is the biological relationship between the children and any male in the household that primarily determines how the family is treated. In an empirical analysis conducted over the period 1996 to 2004 that correctly matches family structure outcomes to welfare rules, we find significant effects of some welfare rules on family structure. We also find that those effects are particularly strong among women on welfare. For all of our results, our findings indicate that the impact of welfare rules crucially hinges on the biological relationship of the male partner to the children in the household.span style=""font-family: 宋体, arial; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;""Note: The &ldquo;WISE-IZA&rdquo; seminar series is transmitted from IZA in Bonn using e-conference technology./span"

In the past decade, many policies related to fiscal decentralization were implemented. However, whether fiscal decentralization acts as a helping hand or grabbing hand on firms remains an open empirical question. This research, in contrast with the extant literature, makes use of micro-data to study the question. It integrates two sets of longitudinal data of individual firms and county-level governments. Using fixed effect and Poisson regression, the research shows that counties given greater fiscal autonomy or implemented with the &ldquo;County-Power Expansion&rdquo; or &ldquo;Province-Managing County&rdquo; policy are more capable of stimulating productivity growth of firms and attracting new firms. The fiscal autonomy and policies can account for as much as a 5% point difference in productivity growth rate and a 2-fold difference in firm birth rate per annum in China. Administrative inefficiency, however, can hamper firms&rsquo; performance and deter new firms."

The complications in such a problem are due to multi-unit capacities and weak preferences, either of which could make a stable matching outcome not necessarily Pareto efficient. A natural solution concept is Pareto stability, which ensures both stability and Pareto efficiency. We show that a Pareto stable matching always exists and develop an efficient algorithm to compute one. For a practical matching market design problem where one side of the market has homogeneous preferences, for instance, course allocation, we propose two new competing Pareto stable mechanisms known as the Pareto-improving draft and dictatorship mechanisms. Using unique course matching data, our simulations show that both mechanisms can significantly improve the overall efficiency and welfare of students compared to the existing mechanism, with the draft mechanism outperforming the dictatorship mechanism despite its non-strategyproofness for the students."

Market failure arises when uncertainty regarding fundamental value and asymmetric information are large in combination. In these cases, firm value and social welfare are improved by a contract where the firm engages a Designated Market Maker (DMM) to enhance liquidity. Our model implies that such contracts represent a market solution to a market imperfection, particularly for small growth firms.

Our work combines strengths of quantile regression and rank-based covariance regularization to simultaneously deal with nonlinearity, nonnormality and high dimensionality for high-dimensional regression. Furthermore, the proposed method strikes a nice balance between robustness and efficiency, achieves the ``oracle''-like convergence rate, and provides the provable prediction interval under the high-dimensional setting where dimension is at a nearly exponential rate to sample size.

One of its limitations is that it does not account for asymmetry in explained variance. Aiming to obtain broad applicable correlation measures, we use a pair of r-squares of generalized regression to deal with asymmetries in explained variances, and linear or nonlinear relations between random variables. We call the pair of r-squares of generalized regression generalized measures of correlation (GMC). We present examples under which the paired measures are identical, and they become a symmetric correlation measure which is the same as the squared Pearson's correlation coefficient. As a result, Pearson's correlation is a special case of GMC. Theoretical properties of GMC show that GMC can be applicable in numerous applications and can lead to more meaningful conclusions and decision making. In statistical inferences, the joint asymptotics of the kernel based estimators for GMC are derived and are used to test whether or not two random variables are symmetric in explaining variances. The testing results give important guidance in practical model selection problems. In real data analysis, this talk presents ideas of using GMCs as an indicator of suitability of asset pricing models, and hence new pricing models may be motivated from this indicator./spanp class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height:17.25pt;mso-pagination:widow-orphan""span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;""o:p/o:p/span"

We explore this issue by studying the case of Protestantism in China during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Combining county-level data on Protestant presence in 1920 and socioeconomic indicators in 2000, we find that the spread of Protestantism has generated significant positive effects in long-term economic growth, educational development, and health care outcomes. To better understand whether the relationship is causal, we exploit the fact that missionaries purposefully undertook disaster relief work to gain the trust of the local people. Thus, we use the frequency of historical disasters as an instrument for Protestant distribution. Our IV results confirm and enhance our OLS results. When we further investigate the transmission channels over the long historical period between 1920 and 2000, we find that although improvements in education and health care outcomes account for a sizable portion of the total effects of missionaries&rsquo; past activities on today&rsquo;s economic outcomes, Protestant activities may have also contributed to long-term economic growth through other channels, such as through transformed social values. If so, then a significant amount of China&rsquo;s growth since 1978 is the result not just of sudden institutional changes but of human capital and social values acquired over a longer historical period.&nbsp;a href=""/EventsMgr/Upload/File/2014/12/20141218094854890.pdf""The paper download/a"

Roughly speaking, algorithmic trading is based on two different time scales: the daily or weekly scale, and a smaller (ten to hundred seconds) time scale. These two time scales essentially reflect the two steps by which the traders slice and place orders. The first step is to optimally slice big orders into smaller ones on a daily basis with the goal to minimize the price impact and/or to maximize the expected utility; the second step is to optimally place the orders within seconds. The former is the well-known optimal execution problem and the latter is the much less-studied optimal placement problem. This talk reviews several simple models and approaches for both problems. Several most relevant statistical issues are discussed, together with a brief discussion on the key differences between the system of limit order book and the multiclass queues with reneging."

Using the Baker and Wurgler (2007) sen-timent index, and for a comprehensive sample of equity-oriented hedge funds over the period 1994-2010, we find strong evidence that, on average, hedge funds with higher sentiment beta subsequently outperform those with lower sentiment beta by about 0.6% per month. The dif-ference in the average returns increases to about 0.82% after controlling for risk factors iden-tified in existing studies. Our findings suggest that noise trader risk is priced in hedge funds.Keywords: Hedge funds, investor sentiment, sentiment risk, sentiment timing, fund returns"

Parents and their children share many common characteristics which are often unobserved --- this causes the omitted-variable bias. To eliminate this bias, we use school interruption during the Chinese Cultural Revolution (CR) as an instrument. The Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) significantly interrupted one generation's education, but has had no direct effect on the next generation. The empirical results suggest that in urban China, a one year decrease in parent's schooling because of school interruption during the CR leads to a 0.27-0.38 year decrease in the child's schooling; if a parent did not obtain a university degree because of school interruption during the CR, the child is 35-53 percent less likely to obtain a university degree. The results also suggest that maternal education may have a greater influence on children's education than paternal education. Overall, for the particular group whose education was changed by the CR, this paper confirms a significant and sizable causal effect on their children's education."

This paper uses the abolition of agricultural tax in 2005 across China as a natural &lsquo;Fiscal squeeze&rsquo; experiment in which the revenue loss of county governments can be largely and quickly offset by tougher tax enforcement. With a focus on the VAT payment by formal firms, this paper claims a novel finding that VAT enforcement is predominantly made by raising the effective VAT rate, rather than by cracking down on the under-reporting of tax base. The incentive for VAT enforcement can be weakened, however, if the county: (1) receives a lower proportion of total VAT revenues after sharing with prefectural and provincial governments; (2) has a broader VAT tax base; or, (3) has more abundant sources of revenue from land sales./span"

This paper aims to investigate whether this is the case. The study uses a panel dataset covering 155 countries, including 33 in the OECD, where China had invested during 2003-09. This is by far the most comprehensive dataset of China&rsquo;s outward foreign direct investment (OFDI). A two-stage least squared (TSLS) regression approach is adopted for our econometric models according to an established augmented gravity model in the literature. The empirical results show clear evidence that China&rsquo;s OFDI displaces that of the OECD countries, but the argument that China&rsquo;s emergence is a &lsquo;new colonialism&rsquo; is not supported as OECD countries&rsquo; OFDI in&nbsp; resource abundant host countries, particularly that in Africa and Latin America, does not appear to have been displaced by China&rsquo;s OFDI./span"

We find that risk shocks lead to simultaneous negative adjustments in leverage,investment, employment and payout, and positive adjustment in cash holdings. Theeconomically significant impact of risk shocks persists for years, and is stronger for firmswith smaller size, lower credit ratings, and negative earnings. Not all policies respond topositive and negative risk shocks symmetrically, i.e., firms appear not to increase payout andreduce cash holdings after risk level reduces. In contrast, ambiguity shocks only lead toshort-term reduction in leverage, which could be partially caused by shrinking externalcredit supply. Managers appear to adopt a ""wait-and-see"" strategy until ambiguity resolves.Keywords: Risk, ambiguity, leverage, investment, employment, payout, cash holdings"

Our baseline results indicate that analyst coverage reduces tax avoidance. Using a Difference-in-Differences approach based on two sources of exogenous changes in information asymmetry caused by broker closures and mergers, we find that firms engage in more tax avoidance activities after an exogenous drop in the number of analysts following the firm, compared to similar firms that do not experience such an exogenous drop in analyst coverage. The evidence therefore suggests a strong negative causal effect of analyst coverage on tax avoidance. We further find that the effects are mainly driven by the firms with smaller initial analyst coverage and more financial constraints. Moreover, the effects are more pronounced in the subset of firms with more information opacity and poorer corporate governance. We further discuss potential channels through which analysts affect tax avoidance: with less competition due to exogenous broker exits, the remaining analysts are producing less informative reports and issuing more biased forecasts. Overall, our paper offers novel evidence that information transparency plays an important role in corporate tax avoidance decisions, and with increased information opacity induced by exogenous drops in analyst coverage, firms are likely to avoid taxes more aggressively.&nbsp;JEL classification: D82; G24; G32; G34; H26; M40&nbsp;Keywords: Information asymmetry; Analyst coverage; Corporate tax avoidance; Natural experiment; Broker closures and mergers&nbsp;"

Several tests for high-dimensional mean vector, based on modifying the classical Hotelling T2 test, have been proposed in the literature. Despite their usefulness, they tend to have unsatisfactory power performance for heavy-tailed multivariate data, which frequently arise in genomics and quantitative finance. This paper proposes a novel high-dimensional nonparametric test for the population mean vector for a general class of multivariate distributions. With the aid of new tools in modern probability theory, we proved that the limiting null distribution of the proposed test is normal under mild conditions when the dimension p is substantially larger than the sample size n. We further study the local power of the proposed test and compare its relative efficiency with a modified Hotelling T2 test for high-dimensional data. An interesting finding is that the newly proposed test can have even more substantial power gain with large p than the traditional nonparametric multivariate test does with finite fixed p. We study the finite sample performance of the proposed test via Monte Carlo simulations. We further illustrate its application by an empirical analysis of a genomics data set."

This impact is statistically and economically significant. Our results reject the view that the ``come-and-go'' nature of FPI, in contrast to FDI that is more persistent, renders it having little real effect on the invested countries.

Then weswitch to the perspective of the hiring firm and analyze which types of displaced workersget hired by firms that are connected to a closing firm via past coworker links. Our resultsindicate that employment status and the firm types of former coworkers are crucial for thejob finding success of their displaced contacts. Moreover, 21% of displaced workers find anew job in a firm that is connected to their former workplace. Among all workers that weredisplaced from the same closing firm those with a direct link to a former coworker are twiceas likely to be hired by the connected firm than workers without a link.

Our aim is to estimate the cross-sectional distributions and/or some dis tributional features of the heterogeneous mean and autocovariances. We do not assume any specific model of the dynamics. Our proposed method is easy to implement: we first compute the sample mean and autocovariances for each individual and then estimate the parameter of interest based on the empirical distributions of the estimated mean and autocovariances. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are investigated using double asymptotics under which both the cross-sectional sample size (N) and the length of the time series (T) tend to infinity. The functional central limit theorem for the empirical process of the proposed distribution estimator is proved. By using the functional delta method, we also derive the asymptotic distribution of the estimator of various parameters of interest. We show that the distribution estimator exhibits a bias whose order is proportional to 1/ T. On the other hand, when the parameter of interest can be written as the expectation of a smooth function of the heterogeneous mean and/or autocovariances, the bias is of order 1/T and can be corrected by the jackknife method. The results of Monte Carlo simulations show that our asymptotic results are informative regarding the finite-sample properties of the estimators.

However, detailed population and death counts at provincial level are often unavailable, except for a few advanced provincial units such as Beijing, Shanghai and Zhejiang. For reasons such as socio-economic differences, mortality patterns among different provinces in China could be highly different; therefore, provincial life tables, instead of aggregated national life tables, are more relevant when we study or manage longevity risk in particular regions of China. In this paper, we develop a disaggregation model that allows us to decompose life table data from national to provincial level. The proposed model is important to the development of longevity securitization in China, as it helps practitioners to assess the usefulness of a Chinese national mortality index for hedging the longevity risk associated with specific pension or annuity portfolios in China.

When a crisis happens, it is almost tautological to note that rating agencies fail to predict it. After all, if rating agencies had foreseen the high risk of specific assets, whether those are senior tranches of asset backed securities, credit default swaps or just sovereign bonds - the overinvestment in this specific asset class would probably have been avoided. However, in particular regarding government bonds (that are the main interest of this paper), the most frequently voiced concern is not the rating agencies' failure to predict, but &quot;unreasonably&quot; bad ratings that in turn cause capital flight, driving the risk premium up, thereby causing further problems that are sanctioned with another rating. When S&amp;P downgraded the French rating from triple to double A on August 11, 2013, the first response of the French government (through minister of finance Pierre Moscovici) was to criticize the &quot;critical and inexact&quot; decision. It is obvious why politicians favor this view of a vicious cycle that can befall the best of us. However, this theory got the highest academical blessings, when supported by the seminal paper by Ferri, Liu and Stiglitz (1999) that tried to find empirical support for this hypothesis using data from the Asian Flu in the late 1990s.&nbsp;A lot of the literature revolving around this issue either focuses on explaining ratings and in particular in proving some arbitrariness of ratings, or on showing that ratings have an impact on capital markets even when the relevant structural explanatory variables are already considered.&nbsp;However, this is not sufficient to address the question whether there is indeed a vicious cycle between ratings and the risk premium that can drive a country from a good to a bad equilibrium. With the present paper, we aim at filling this gap in the literature. Contrary to most of the literature that tries to explain ratings in details, we deliberately employ a very parsimonious bivariate specification to focus on the interaction between the interest rate and ratings. We propose a model that is inspired by Pesaran type cointegration models. We allow for nonlinearities in a form that allows for both unique, multiple and an infinite number of equilibria. Even though not imposing a unique equilibrium through the model specification, our results strongly favor a model that yields a unique equilibrium.&nbsp;"

This talk is about an result of initial research work to identify and&nbsp;ordain order of key parameters in a Korean CGE model. In the work, (i) a Monte Carlo simulation randomly draws exogenous parameters (X), (ii) the CGE model&nbsp;calculates corresponding endogenous outcomes (Y), (iii) repeat the procedure of (i) and (ii) n times to yield sample data of X and Y of size n, and (iv) finally&nbsp;a standard regression analysis estimates the relationship of X and Y.

Consistent with the theoretical predictions of a general-equilibrium model of wage setting with weather risk, we find that both labor demand and equilibrium wages become more rainfall sensitive when cultivators are offered rainfall insurance, because insurance induces cultivators to switch to riskier, higher-yield production methods. The same insurance contract offered to agricultural laborers smoothes wages across rainfall states by reducing labor supply during droughts (when insurance payouts occur). Policy simulations based on our estimates suggest that selling insurance only to land-owning cultivators (which is the current regulatory practice in India and other developing countries) makes wage laborers worse off in some states of the world due to the increase in wage volatility, relative to a situation where insurance does not exist at all. Marketing insurance to both cultivators and the landless eliminates this adverse effect on the landless, and mildly increases average wages compared to a regime of no insurance.ispan lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;TimesNewRomanPSMT&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;color:#C45911;mso-font-kerning:0pt""Note: The &ldquo;WISE-IZA&rdquo; seminar series is transmitted from IZA in Bonn using e-conference technology./span/ip class=""MsoNormal"" align=""left""span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;TimesNewRomanPSMT&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;color:#C45911;mso-font-kerning:0pt""o:p/o:p/span&nbsp;span style=""font-family: 楷体_GB2312; font-size: 12pt;""摘要：/spanspan style=""font-family: 楷体_GB2312; font-size: 12pt;""本文估计了一个在印度做的随机控制实验的一般均衡劳动力市场效应。在这个实验向农场主和农业劳工提供与降雨指标挂钩的保险产品。与有天气风险的工资决定的一般均衡理论模型的预期相一致，我们发现农场主有降雨保险时劳动需求和均衡工资对降雨更敏感。这个情况下保险使得农场主更多的使用风险更高、产出更高的生产方法。当农业劳工有同样的保险时，他们在不同降雨情况下的工资更加平滑，这主要是因为干旱时他们可以得到保险赔偿因此他们的劳动供给减少。基于我们估计的政策模拟显示仅仅向土地拥有者的农场主提供保险在一些情况下可能使得农业劳动的福利受损。而在印度和其他发展中国家这是比较常见的方式。这样的方式相对没有保险的情况使得劳工的工资波动增加。如果能同时向农场主和农业劳工提供保险可以消除这种对于没有土地的劳工的负面影响，相对于没有保险的情形也同时可以提高平均工资。/span&nbsp;ispan style=""font-size:11.0pt;font-family:楷体;mso-bidi-font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;color:#C45911;mso-font-kerning:0pt""注：本系列讲座使用远程会议系统传输自德国波恩的/span/iispan lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:楷体;color:#C45911;mso-font-kerning:0pt""IZA/span/iispan style=""font-size:11.0pt;font-family:楷体;mso-bidi-font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;color:#C45911;mso-font-kerning:0pt""总部。/span/ip class=""MsoNormal""ispan style=""font-size:11.0pt;font-family:楷体;mso-bidi-font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;color:#C45911;mso-font-kerning:0pt""span lang=""EN-US""o:p/o:p/span/span/ia href=""/EventsMgr/Upload/File/2014/11/20141103093159175.PDF""Paper download/a"

From this perspective, important aspects of unemployment causality are a product of prospective workers having access to non-labor market sources of income. Only by making prospective workers desperate will unemployment be reduced and labor supply increased.

I argue and show that the insatiable wants assumption is most consistent with a variant of a target income modeling of labor supply. To the extent that target income is not reached, neither increasing real wages nor increasing non-market sources of real income need reduce the supply of market labor.

The standard identifying assumption that the self-employed underreport income whereas wage and salary workers do not is likely to fail in countries where employees are often paid under the table or have a secondary source of self-employed income. Assuming that evading individuals have a higher consumption-income gap than non-evading ones due underreporting both to tax authorities and in surveys, an endogenous switching model with unknown sample separation enables the estimation of consumption-income gaps for both underreporting and truthful households. This avoids the need to identify non-evading and evading groups ex-ante. Using data from household budget surveys in eight post-communist countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Georgia, Armenia, Croatia, Serbia, Russian and Ukraine) we find that estimated evasion is substantially higher than found using previous methodologies. We also use difference-in-difference techniques to measure the impact of tax reform reducing marginal rates on the extent of under-reporting, finding some evidence of such an effect in high marginal tax regimes.div align=""left""iNote: The &ldquo;WISE-IZA&rdquo; seminar series is transmitted from IZA in Bonn using e-conference technology./i&nbsp;摘要：我们提出了一个新的方法估计未申报收入（比如由于避税原因）。这个估计量不像之前基于微观数据的估计量依赖于严格的识别假设。这方面标准的识别假设是自雇个体低报收入而受雇的工人不会低报收入。这样的假设对于用人单位经常私下支付员工的经济体或者自雇收入有多个来源的经济体显然并不适用。我们的假设是避税的个体在消费-收入差比没有避税的个体要高，因为避税个体的收入在向税务机关以及访谈中要比实际值偏低。基于这样的假设，我们设定了一个内生的机制转换模型，其中可以包括未知的样本分隔。这样我们可以同时估计低报群体以及真实报告群体的消费-收入差。我们的方法可以无须事先识别这两个群体。使用8个前社会主义国家（捷克共和国，斯洛伐克，格鲁吉亚，亚美尼亚，克罗地亚，塞尔维亚，俄罗斯和乌克兰）的家户预算调查数据，我们发现税收规避的发生率比之前文献中所识别的要高。我们也同时使用双差法测度降低边际税率的税收改革对税收规避发生率的影响，并在高边际税率地区找到了一些预期的影响。"

She is the director of the Early Childhood Research Team which consists of senior and junior researchers who focus on the micro analysis of human behaviour using rigorous methodologies, with a particular focus on early child development. She is currently the principal investigator on the six year evaluation of the &lsquo;Preparing for Life&rsquo; early childhood intervention. She was recently appointed Assistant Director of the UCD Childhood and Human Development Research Centre and was elected Chair of the Children&rsquo;s Research Network for Ireland and Northern Ireland.&nbsp; Dr. Doyle received her Ph.D. in economics from Trinity College Dublin in 2005 and holds a B.A. in economics and social science.",Early Skill Formation and the Efficiency of Parental Investment: A Rand...,经济楼A座217会议室,"                                                                div align=""left"" style=""text-align: left; line-height: 19.5pt; background: white""bspan style=""color: black; font-size: 11pt""Abstract:/span/bspan style=""color: black; font-size: 11pt""&nbsp;Intervening early in a child&rsquo;s life has been shown to be effective from a biological and economic perspective. Early intervention can reduce socioeconomic disparities in children's capabilities, yet the evidence base in restricted to a small number of US trials.&nbsp;This study investigates the impact of the Preparing for Life (PFL) programme from birth until 24 months using a randomized control trial design. PFL is a five year home visiting program which aims to improve the life course of disadvantaged Irish children by intervening during pregnancy and working with the families until the children start school. The treatment involves regular home visits from a mentor to support parenting and child development using Tip Sheets. This study explores program impact by comparing the treatment (n=115) and control (n=118) groups using permutation testing methods and a stepdown procedure to account for the small sample size and the increased likelihood of false discoveries when examining multiple outcomes. Significant treatment effects are identified for labour experiences at birth and child health at each time point; yet the majority of effects on child development are restricted to 24 months. There is also some evidence that the program raises the efficiency of parental investment by improving the quality of the home environment and parenting skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/span"

Particular attention is given to the Canadian program of TFWs that has intensified enormously over the last 30 years. Results of the empirical analysis are analyzed through the lens of a small theoretical model that incorporates a job-matching framework (Pissarid&egrave;s, 1985, 2000) in a migration model &agrave; la Harris and Todaro (1970). We find that the inflow of TFWs into a given province tends to substantially decrease net interprovincial mobility. This is not the case, however, for the inflow of permanent immigrants selected through the Canadian point system. On average, each inflow of 100 TFWs is found to decrease net interprovincial migrants within the year by about 50, a number substantially higher than is present in existing literature. This number increases to 180 in the long run. The negative impact of TFWs is ascribed to the fact that TFWs are hired directly by employers, take vacant jobs, and display employment and participation rates of close to 100 per cent. Our paper suggests that, in general, the impact of immigration on labor market conditions depends critically on the way immigrants are selected. br /&nbsp;br /摘要：本文分析临时外国工人(TFW)以及永久移民对于加拿大本地人跨省流动的影响。我们特别关注的是在过去30年间增长迅速的TFW项目下的工人。我们的实证研究基于融合了工作匹配理论(Pissarid&egrave;s, 1985, 2000)和移民理论(Harris and Todaro, 1970)的一个小型理论模型。我们的研究发现随着TFW流入某个省份，该省的跨省人员流动会明显下降。但是，根据加拿大积分制度流入的永久居民对于跨省流动却没有这样的影响。平均而言，每100位TFW会在一年内减少50人的跨省人员净流动数。这个数字比现有文献中的数据要高很多。而在长期，这个数字会更达到180. TFW的负面作用在于他们是被用人单位直接雇佣，因此占据了空闲的职位使得本地人的就业被挤压。当然，他们的劳动参与率基本接近100%。 我们的研究表明，总体上看，移民对于劳动力市场的影响受因移民的挑选程序而异。"

The model features overlapping generations of individuals who self-select into education, employment, and occupations in an environment with competitive markets and exogenous demand and supply shifts. It departs from existing general equilibrium studies by adopting a rich characterization of heterogeneity in the form of continuous two-dimensional ability distributions. The model is fit to the Current Population Survey and successfully matches trends in the U.S. labor market. The estimated model reveals changes in the ability composition of the workforce. Using the model as a basis for experiments, I first quantify the impact of exogenous demand and supply forces and highlight their general equilibrium interactions. I then assess composition effects and highlight the importance of ability heterogeneity in shaping labor market outcomes.

Our metric is a natural extension of the recently proposed distance correlation, which is used to measure the dependence between V and U. The martingale difference correlation and its empirical counterpart inherit a number of desirable features of distance correlation and sample distance correlation, such as algebraic simplicity and elegant theoretical properties. We further use martingale difference correlation as a marginal utility to do high dimensional feature screening to screen out variables that do not contribute to conditional mean of the response given the covariates. An extension to conditional quantile screening will be described and sure screening consistency for both screening procedures will also be presented. I will conclude the talk by showing selected simulation results and a real data illustration, which demonstrate the effectiveness of martingale difference correlation based screening procedures in comparison with the existing counterparts./span"

Instead, output convergence has proceeded among four subgroups within which states have certain characteristics in common. Our regression analysis suggests that state-level characteristics related to technology and human capital play an important role in accounting for the formation and composition of convergence clubs, in line with the prediction of recent theories of growth and development (e.g., Aghion et al. 2009, Gennaioli et al. 2013b). The level of technology, proxied by patents, turns out to be a consistently significant determinant even after controlling for endogeneity. Our result therefore lends credence to the view that frictions in the diffusion of technology and human capital led to clustering of states with different levels of output./span"

In this presentation, we will introduce varies of MBS products, such as Pass-Through, CMO, PAC, etc. and discuss the risks associated with the MBS products. In addition, we will investigate the pricing methods for MBS bonds and related products. We consider the convergence on Monte Carlo methods for pricing MBS bonds and their Option Adjusted Spread (OAS), duration and convexity. Two types of convergence, relative convergence and absolute convergence are introduced while using the Monte Carlo methods. We propose a Monte Carlo method using the relative convergence. Our results indicate that the computational time can be reduced by up to 95%.&nbsp;"
